Athens. A room in the Palace of THESEUS.\r\n\r\n[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants.]\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nNow, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour\r\nDraws on apace; four happy days bring in\r\nAnother moon; but, oh, methinks, how slow\r\nThis old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,\r\nLike to a step-dame or a dowager,\r\nLong withering out a young man's revenue.\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA\r\nFour days will quickly steep themselves in nights;\r\nFour nights will quickly dream away the time;\r\nAnd then the moon, like to a silver bow\r\nNew bent in heaven, shall behold the night\r\nOf our solemnities.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\n                    Go, Philostrate,\r\nStir up the Athenian youth to merriments;\r\nAwake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;\r\nTurn melancholy forth to funerals--\r\nThe pale companion is not for our pomp. --\r\n\r\n[Exit PHILOSTRATE.]\r\n\r\nHippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,\r\nAnd won thy love doing thee injuries;\r\nBut I will wed thee in another key,\r\nWith pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.\r\n\r\n[Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS.]\r\n\r\nEGEUS\r\nHappy be Theseus, our renowned duke!\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nThanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?\r\n\r\nEGEUS\r\nFull of vexation come I, with complaint\r\nAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia.--\r\nStand forth, Demetrius.--My noble lord,\r\nThis man hath my consent to marry her:--\r\nStand forth, Lysander;--and, my gracious duke,\r\nThis man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child.\r\nThou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,\r\nAnd interchang'd love-tokens with my child:\r\nThou hast by moonlight at her window sung,\r\nWith feigning voice, verses of feigning love;\r\nAnd stol'n the impression of her fantasy\r\nWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,\r\nKnacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats,--messengers\r\nOf strong prevailment in unharden'd youth;--\r\nWith cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;\r\nTurned her obedience, which is due to me,\r\nTo stubborn harshness.--And, my gracious duke,\r\nBe it so she will not here before your grace\r\nConsent to marry with Demetrius,\r\nI beg the ancient privilege of Athens,--\r\nAs she is mine I may dispose of her:\r\nWhich shall be either to this gentleman\r\nOr to her death; according to our law\r\nImmediately provided in that case.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nWhat say you, Hermia? be advis'd, fair maid:\r\nTo you your father should be as a god;\r\nOne that compos'd your beauties: yea, and one\r\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax,\r\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\r\nTo leave the figure, or disfigure it.\r\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nSo is Lysander.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\n                In himself he is:\r\nBut, in this kind, wanting your father's voice,\r\nThe other must be held the worthier.\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nI would my father look'd but with my eyes.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nI do entreat your grace to pardon me.\r\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\r\nNor how it may concern my modesty\r\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts:\r\nBut I beseech your grace that I may know\r\nThe worst that may befall me in this case\r\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nEither to die the death, or to abjure\r\nFor ever the society of men.\r\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\r\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\r\nWhether, if you yield not to your father's choice,\r\nYou can endure the livery of a nun;\r\nFor aye to be shady cloister mew'd,\r\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\r\nChanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon.\r\nThrice-blessed they that master so their blood\r\nTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage:\r\nBut earthlier happy is the rose distill'd\r\nThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\r\nGrows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nSo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,\r\nEre I will yield my virgin patent up\r\nUnto his lordship, whose unwished yoke\r\nMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nTake time to pause; and by the next new moon,--\r\nThe sealing-day betwixt my love and me\r\nFor everlasting bond of fellowship,--\r\nUpon that day either prepare to die\r\nFor disobedience to your father's will;\r\nOr else to wed Demetrius, as he would;\r\nOr on Diana's altar to protest\r\nFor aye austerity and single life.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\nRelent, sweet Hermia;--and, Lysander, yield\r\nThy crazed title to my certain right.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nYou have her father's love, Demetrius;\r\nLet me have Hermia's: do you marry him.\r\n\r\nEGEUS\r\nScornful Lysander! true, he hath my love;\r\nAnd what is mine my love shall render him;\r\nAnd she is mine; and all my right of her\r\nI do estate unto Demetrius.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nI am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,\r\nAs well possess'd; my love is more than his;\r\nMy fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,\r\nIf not with vantage, as Demetrius's;\r\nAnd, which is more than all these boasts can be,\r\nI am belov'd of beauteous Hermia:\r\nWhy should not I then prosecute my right?\r\nDemetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,\r\nMade love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,\r\nAnd won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,\r\nDevoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,\r\nUpon this spotted and inconstant man.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nI must confess that I have heard so much,\r\nAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;\r\nBut, being over-full of self-affairs,\r\nMy mind did lose it.--But, Demetrius, come;\r\nAnd come, Egeus; you shall go with me;\r\nI have some private schooling for you both.--\r\nFor you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\r\nTo fit your fancies to your father's will,\r\nOr else the law of Athens yields you up,--\r\nWhich by no means we may extenuate,--\r\nTo death, or to a vow of single life.--\r\nCome, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?\r\nDemetrius, and Egeus, go along;\r\nI must employ you in some business\r\nAgainst our nuptial, and confer with you\r\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\r\n\r\nEGEUS\r\nWith duty and desire we follow you.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, DEMETRIUS, and Train.]\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nHow now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?\r\nHow chance the roses there do fade so fast?\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nBelike for want of rain, which I could well\r\nBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nAh me! for aught that I could ever read,\r\nCould ever hear by tale or history,\r\nThe course of true love never did run smooth:\r\nBut either it was different in blood,--\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nO cross! Too high to be enthrall'd to low!\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nOr else misgraffed in respect of years;--\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nO spite! Too old to be engag'd to young!\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nOr else it stood upon the choice of friends:\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nO hell! to choose love by another's eye!\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nOr, if there were a sympathy in choice,\r\nWar, death, or sickness, did lay siege to it,\r\nMaking it momentary as a sound,\r\nSwift as a shadow, short as any dream;\r\nBrief as the lightning in the collied night\r\nThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,\r\nAnd ere a man hath power to say, Behold!\r\nThe jaws of darkness do devour it up:\r\nSo quick bright things come to confusion.\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nIf then true lovers have ever cross'd,\r\nIt stands as an edict in destiny:\r\nThen let us teach our trial patience,\r\nBecause it is a customary cross;\r\nAs due to love as thoughts, and dreams, and sighs,\r\nWishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nA good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.\r\nI have a widow aunt, a dowager\r\nOf great revenue, and she hath no child:\r\nFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues;\r\nAnd she respects me as her only son.\r\nThere, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;\r\nAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law\r\nCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,\r\nSteal forth thy father's house tomorrow night;\r\nAnd in the wood, a league without the town,\r\nWhere I did meet thee once with Helena,\r\nTo do observance to a morn of May,\r\nThere will I stay for thee.\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\n                            My good Lysander!\r\nI swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,\r\nBy his best arrow, with the golden head,\r\nBy the simplicity of Venus' doves,\r\nBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\r\nAnd by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,\r\nWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,--\r\nBy all the vows that ever men have broke,\r\nIn number more than ever women spoke,--\r\nIn that same place thou hast appointed me,\r\nTomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\r\n\r\n[Enter HELENA.]\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nGod speed fair Helena! Whither away?\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nCall you me fair? that fair again unsay.\r\nDemetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!\r\nYour eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air\r\nMore tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,\r\nWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\r\nSickness is catching: O, were favour so,\r\nYours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;\r\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,\r\nMy tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.\r\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\r\nThe rest I'd give to be to you translated.\r\nO, teach me how you look; and with what art\r\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius' heart!\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nO that my prayers could such affection move!\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nNone, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nTake comfort; he no more shall see my face;\r\nLysander and myself will fly this place.--\r\nBefore the time I did Lysander see,\r\nSeem'd Athens as a paradise to me:\r\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell,\r\nThat he hath turn'd a heaven unto hell!\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold:\r\nTo-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold\r\nHer silver visage in the watery glass,\r\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,--\r\nA time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,--\r\nThrough Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\r\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\r\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\r\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet:\r\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes,\r\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\r\nFarewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us,\r\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!--\r\nKeep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight\r\nFrom lovers' food, till morrow deep midnight.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nI will, my Hermia.\r\n\r\n[Exit HERMIA.]\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\n                   Helena, adieu:\r\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\r\n\r\n[Exit LYSANDER.]\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nHow happy some o'er other some can be!\r\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\r\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;\r\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\r\nAnd as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,\r\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\r\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\r\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\r\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;\r\nAnd therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.\r\nNor hath love's mind of any judgment taste;\r\nWings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:\r\nAnd therefore is love said to be a child,\r\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguil'd.\r\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\r\nSo the boy Love is perjur'd everywhere:\r\nFor ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,\r\nHe hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;\r\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\r\nSo he dissolv'd, and showers of oaths did melt.\r\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight;\r\nThen to the wood will he to-morrow night\r\nPursue her; and for this intelligence\r\nIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense:\r\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\r\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\r\n\r\n[Exit HELENA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage.\r\n\r\n[Enter SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, QUINCE, and STARVELING.]\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nIs all our company here?\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nYou were best to call them generally, man by man,\r\naccording to the scrip.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nHere is the scroll of every man's name, which is thought\r\nfit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the\r\nduke and duchess on his wedding-day at night.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nFirst, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on;\r\nthen read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nMarry, our play is--The most lamentable comedy and most\r\ncruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nA very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry.--\r\nNow, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll.--\r\nMasters, spread yourselves.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nAnswer, as I call you.--Nick Bottom, the weaver.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nReady. Name what part I am for, and proceed.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nYou, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nWhat is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nA lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nThat will ask some tears in the true performing of it.\r\nIf I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move\r\nstorms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest:--yet my\r\nchief humour is for a tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a\r\npart to tear a cat in, to make all split.\r\n\r\nThe raging rocks\r\nAnd shivering shocks\r\nShall break the locks\r\n    Of prison gates:\r\n\r\nAnd Phibbus' car\r\nShall shine from far,\r\nAnd make and mar\r\n    The foolish Fates.\r\n\r\nThis was lofty.--Now name the rest of the players.--This is\r\nErcles' vein, a tyrant's vein;--a lover is more condoling.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nFrancis Flute, the bellows-mender.\r\n\r\nFLUTE\r\nHere, Peter Quince.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nFlute, you must take Thisby on you.\r\n\r\nFLUTE\r\nWhat is Thisby? a wandering knight?\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nIt is the lady that Pyramus must love.\r\n\r\nFLUTE\r\nNay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nThat's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as\r\nsmall as you will.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nAn I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too:\r\nI'll speak in a monstrous little voice;--'Thisne, Thisne!'--\r\n'Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear; thy Thisby dear! and lady dear!'\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nNo, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nWell, proceed.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nRobin Starveling, the tailor.\r\n\r\nSTARVELING\r\nHere, Peter Quince.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nRobin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.--\r\nTom Snout, the tinker.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nHere, Peter Quince.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nYou, Pyramus' father; myself, Thisby's father;--Snug,\r\nthe joiner, you, the lion's part:--and, I hope, here is a play\r\nfitted.\r\n\r\nSNUG\r\nHave you the lion's part written? pray you, if it be, give it\r\nme, for I am slow of study.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nYou may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nLet me play the lion too: I will roar that I will do\r\nany man's heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will make the\r\nduke say 'Let him roar again, let him roar again.'\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nAn you should do it too terribly, you would fright the\r\nduchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were\r\nenough to hang us all.\r\n\r\nALL\r\nThat would hang us every mother's son.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nI grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies\r\nout of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang\r\nus: but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as\r\ngently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any\r\nnightingale.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nYou can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a\r\nsweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's\r\nday; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must\r\nneeds play Pyramus.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nWell, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nWhy, what you will.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nI will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard,\r\nyour orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your\r\nFrench-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nSome of your French crowns have no hair at all, and\r\nthen you will play bare-faced.-- But, masters, here are your\r\nparts: and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to\r\ncon them by to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a\r\nmile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse: for\r\nif we meet in the city, we shall be dogg'd with company, and our\r\ndevices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties,\r\nsuch as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nWe will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely\r\nand courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nAt the duke's oak we meet.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nEnough; hold, or cut bow-strings.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I. A wood near Athens.\r\n\r\n[Enter a FAIRY at One door, and PUCK at another.]\r\n\r\nPUCK\r\nHow now, spirit! whither wander you?\r\n\r\nFAIRY\r\n    Over hill, over dale,\r\n      Thorough bush, thorough brier,\r\n    Over park, over pale,\r\n      Thorough flood, thorough fire,\r\n    I do wander everywhere,\r\n    Swifter than the moon's sphere;\r\n    And I serve the fairy queen,\r\n    To dew her orbs upon the green.\r\n    The cowslips tall her pensioners be:\r\n    In their gold coats spots you see;\r\n    Those be rubies, fairy favours,\r\n    In those freckles live their savours;\r\nI must go seek some dew-drops here,\r\nAnd hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.\r\nFarewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:\r\nOur queen and all her elves come here anon.\r\n\r\nPUCK\r\nThe king doth keep his revels here to-night;\r\nTake heed the Queen come not within his sight.\r\nFor Oberon is passing fell and wrath,\r\nBecause that she, as her attendant, hath\r\nA lovely boy, stol'n from an Indian king;\r\nShe never had so sweet a changeling:\r\nAnd jealous Oberon would have the child\r\nKnight of his train, to trace the forests wild:\r\nBut she perforce withholds the loved boy,\r\nCrowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy:\r\nAnd now they never meet in grove or green,\r\nBy fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,\r\nBut they do square; that all their elves for fear\r\nCreep into acorn cups, and hide them there.\r\n\r\nFAIRY\r\nEither I mistake your shape and making quite,\r\nOr else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite\r\nCall'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he\r\nThat frights the maidens of the villagery;\r\nSkim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,\r\nAnd bootless make the breathless housewife churn;\r\nAnd sometime make the drink to bear no barm;\r\nMislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?\r\nThose that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,\r\nYou do their work, and they shall have good luck:\r\nAre not you he?\r\n\r\nPUCK\r\n                Thou speak'st aright;\r\nI am that merry wanderer of the night.\r\nI jest to Oberon, and make him smile,\r\nWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,\r\nNeighing in likeness of a filly foal;\r\nAnd sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,\r\nIn very likeness of a roasted crab;\r\nAnd, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,\r\nAnd on her withered dewlap pour the ale.\r\nThe wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,\r\nSometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;\r\nThen slip I from her bum, down topples she,\r\nAnd 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;\r\nAnd then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe,\r\nAnd waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear\r\nA merrier hour was never wasted there.--\r\nBut room, fairy, here comes Oberon.\r\n\r\nFAIRY\r\nAnd here my mistress.--Would that he were gone!\r\n\r\n[Enter OBERON at one door, with his Train, and TITANIA,\r\nat another, with hers.]\r\n\r\nOBERON\r\nIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.\r\n\r\nTITANIA\r\nWhat, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;\r\nI have forsworn his bed and company.\r\n\r\nOBERON\r\nTarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?\r\n\r\nTITANIA\r\nThen I must be thy lady; but I know\r\nWhen thou hast stol'n away from fairy-land,\r\nAnd in the shape of Corin sat all day,\r\nPlaying on pipes of corn, and versing love\r\nTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\r\nCome from the farthest steep of India,\r\nBut that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\r\nYour buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,\r\nTo Theseus must be wedded; and you come\r\nTo give their bed joy and prosperity.\r\n\r\nOBERON\r\nHow canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,\r\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\r\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\r\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering night\r\nFrom Perigenia, whom he ravish'd?\r\nAnd make him with fair Aegle break his faith,\r\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\r\n\r\nTITANIA\r\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy:\r\nAnd never, since the middle summer's spring,\r\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\r\nBy paved fountain, or by rushy brook,\r\nOr on the beached margent of the sea,\r\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\r\nBut with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.\r\nTherefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\r\nAs in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea\r\nContagious fogs; which, falling in the land,\r\nHath every pelting river made so proud\r\nThat they have overborne their continents:\r\nThe ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,\r\nThe ploughman lost his sweat; and the green corn\r\nHath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard:\r\nThe fold stands empty in the drowned field,\r\nAnd crows are fatted with the murrion flock;\r\nThe nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud;\r\nAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\r\nFor lack of tread, are undistinguishable:\r\nThe human mortals want their winter here;\r\nNo night is now with hymn or carol blest:--\r\nTherefore the moon, the governess of floods,\r\nPale in her anger, washes all the air,\r\nThat rheumatic diseases do abound:\r\nAnd thorough this distemperature we see\r\nThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\r\nFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;\r\nAnd on old Hyem's thin and icy crown\r\nAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\r\nIs, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,\r\nThe childing autumn, angry winter, change\r\nTheir wonted liveries; and the maz'd world,\r\nBy their increase, now knows not which is which:\r\nAnd this same progeny of evils comes\r\nFrom our debate, from our dissension:\r\nWe are their parents and original.\r\n\r\nOBERON\r\nDo you amend it, then: it lies in you:\r\nWhy should Titania cross her Oberon?\r\nI do but beg a little changeling boy\r\nTo be my henchman.\r\n\r\nTITANIA\r\n                   Set your heart at rest;\r\nThe fairy-land buys not the child of me.\r\nHis mother was a vot'ress of my order:\r\nAnd, in the spiced Indian air, by night,\r\nFull often hath she gossip'd by my side;\r\nAnd sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,\r\nMarking the embarked traders on the flood;\r\nWhen we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive,\r\nAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\r\nWhich she, with pretty and with swimming gait\r\nFollowing,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--\r\nWould imitate; and sail upon the land,\r\nTo fetch me trifles, and return again,\r\nAs from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\r\nBut she, being mortal, of that boy did die;\r\nAnd for her sake do I rear up her boy:\r\nAnd for her sake I will not part with him.\r\n\r\nOBERON\r\nHow long within this wood intend you stay?\r\n\r\nTITANIA\r\nPerchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.\r\nIf you will patiently dance in our round,\r\nAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us;\r\nIf not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\r\n\r\nOBERON\r\nGive me that boy and I will go with thee.\r\n\r\nTITANIA\r\nNot for thy fairy kingdom.

I am invisible;\r\nAnd I will overhear their conference.\r\n\r\n[Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA following him.]\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\nI love thee not, therefore pursue me not.\r\nWhere is Lysander and fair Hermia?\r\nThe one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.\r\nThou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood,\r\nAnd here am I, and wode within this wood,\r\nBecause I cannot meet with Hermia.\r\nHence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nYou draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;\r\nBut yet you draw not iron, for my heart\r\nIs true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,\r\nAnd I shall have no power to follow you.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\nDo I entice you? Do I speak you fair?\r\nOr, rather, do I not in plainest truth\r\nTell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nAnd even for that do I love you the more.\r\nI am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,\r\nThe more you beat me, I will fawn on you:\r\nUse me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,\r\nNeglect me, lose me; only give me leave,\r\nUnworthy as I am, to follow you.\r\nWhat worser place can I beg in your love,\r\nAnd yet a place of high respect with me,--\r\nThan to be used as you use your dog?\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\nTempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;\r\nFor I am sick when I do look on thee.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nAnd I am sick when I look not on you.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\nYou do impeach your modesty too much,\r\nTo leave the city, and commit yourself\r\nInto the hands of one that loves you not;\r\nTo trust the opportunity of night,\r\nAnd the ill counsel of a desert place,\r\nWith the rich worth of your virginity.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nYour virtue is my privilege for that.\r\nIt is not night when I do see your face,\r\nTherefore I think I am not in the night;\r\nNor doth this wood lack worlds of company;\r\nFor you, in my respect, are all the world:\r\nThen how can it be said I am alone\r\nWhen all the world is here to look on me?\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\nI'll run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,\r\nAnd leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nThe wildest hath not such a heart as you.\r\nRun when you will, the story shall be chang'd;\r\nApollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;\r\nThe dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind\r\nMakes speed to catch the tiger,--bootless speed,\r\nWhen cowardice pursues and valour flies.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\nI will not stay thy questions; let me go:\r\nOr, if thou follow me, do not believe\r\nBut I shall do thee mischief in the wood.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nAy, in the temple, in the town, the field,\r\nYou do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!\r\nYour wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:\r\nWe cannot fight for love as men may do:\r\nWe should be woo'd, and were not made to woo.\r\nI'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,\r\nTo die upon the hand I love so well.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt DEMETRIUS and HELENA.]\r\n\r\nOBERON\r\nFare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,\r\nThou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.--\r\n\r\n[Re-enter PUCK.]\r\n\r\nHast thou the flower there?

This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn\r\nbrake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will\r\ndo it before the duke.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nPeter Quince,--\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nWhat sayest thou, bully Bottom?\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nThere are things in this comedy of 'Pyramus and Thisby' that\r\nwill never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill\r\nhimself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nBy'r lakin, a parlous fear.\r\n\r\nSTARVELING\r\nI believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nNot a whit: I have a device to make all well. Write me a\r\nprologue; and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm\r\nwith our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for\r\nthe more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not\r\nPyramus but Bottom the weaver: this will put them out of fear.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nWell, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be\r\nwritten in eight and six.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nNo, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nWill not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\r\n\r\nSTARVELING\r\nI fear it, I promise you.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nMasters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to bring in,\r\nGod shield us! a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing:\r\nfor there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living;\r\nand we ought to look to it.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nTherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nNay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen\r\nthrough the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through,\r\nsaying thus, or to the same defect,--'Ladies,' or, 'Fair ladies, I\r\nwould wish you, or, I would request you, or, I would entreat you,\r\nnot to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I\r\ncome hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such\r\nthing; I am a man as other men are:'--and there, indeed, let him\r\nname his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nWell, it shall be so. But there is two hard things; that\r\nis, to bring the moonlight into a chamber: for, you know,\r\nPyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nDoth the moon shine that night we play our play?\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nA calendar, a calendar! look in the almanack; find out\r\nmoonshine, find out moonshine.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nYes, it doth shine that night.\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nWhy, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber-window,\r\nwhere we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nAy; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a\r\nlantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person\r\nof moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a\r\nwall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the\r\nstory, did talk through the chink of a wall.\r\n\r\nSNOUT\r\nYou can never bring in a wall.--What say you, Bottom?\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nSome man or other must present wall: and let him have\r\nsome plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to\r\nsignify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that\r\ncranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.\r\n\r\nQUINCE\r\nIf that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every\r\nmother's son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin:\r\nwhen you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so\r\nevery one according to his cue.\r\n\r\n[Enter PUCK behind.]\r\n\r\nPUCK\r\nWhat hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,\r\nSo near the cradle of the fairy queen?\r\nWhat, a play toward!

I am not yet so low\r\nBut that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\nI pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,\r\nLet her not hurt me. I was never curst;\r\nI have no gift at all in shrewishness;\r\nI am a right maid for my cowardice;\r\nLet her not strike me.

A cry more tuneable\r\nWas never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,\r\nIn Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.\r\nJudge when you hear.--But, soft, what nymphs are these?\r\n\r\nEGEUS\r\nMy lord, this is my daughter here asleep;\r\nAnd this Lysander; this Demetrius is;\r\nThis Helena, old Nedar's Helena:\r\nI wonder of their being here together.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nNo doubt they rose up early to observe\r\nThe rite of May; and, hearing our intent,\r\nCame here in grace of our solemnity.--\r\nBut speak, Egeus; is not this the day\r\nThat Hermia should give answer of her choice?\r\n\r\nEGEUS\r\nIt is, my lord.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nGo, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.\r\n\r\n[Horns, and shout within.

To her, my lord,\r\nWas I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:\r\nBut, like a sickness, did I loathe this food;\r\nBut, as in health, come to my natural taste,\r\nNow I do wish it, love it, long for it,\r\nAnd will for evermore be true to it.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nFair lovers, you are fortunately met:\r\nOf this discourse we more will hear anon.--\r\nEgeus, I will overbear your will;\r\nFor in the temple, by and by with us,\r\nThese couples shall eternally be knit.\r\nAnd, for the morning now is something worn,\r\nOur purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.--\r\nAway with us to Athens, three and three,\r\nWe'll hold a feast in great solemnity.--\r\nCome, Hippolyta.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and Train.]\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\nThese things seem small and undistinguishable,\r\nLike far-off mountains turned into clouds.\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nMethinks I see these things with parted eye,\r\nWhen every thing seems double.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\n                               So methinks:\r\nAnd I have found Demetrius like a jewel.\r\nMine own, and not mine own.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\n                            It seems to me\r\nThat yet we sleep, we dream.--Do not you think\r\nThe duke was here, and bid us follow him?\r\n\r\nHERMIA\r\nYea, and my father.\r\n\r\nHELENA\r\n                    And Hippolyta.\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\nAnd he did bid us follow to the temple.\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\nWhy, then, we are awake: let's follow him;\r\nAnd by the way let us recount our dreams.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n[As they go out, BOTTOM awakes.]\r\n\r\nBOTTOM\r\nWhen my cue comes, call me, and I will answer.

I have had a most rare\r\nvision. I have had a dream--past the wit of man to say\r\nwhat dream it was.--Man is but an ass if he go about\r\nto expound this dream. Methought I was--there is no man can tell\r\nwhat. Methought I was, and methought I had,--but man is but a\r\npatched fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had. The\r\neye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen; man's\r\nhand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart\r\nto report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a\r\nballad of this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream, because\r\nit hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a\r\nplay, before the duke: peradventure, to make it the more\r\ngracious, I shall sing it at her death.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.

I never may believe\r\nThese antique fables, nor these fairy toys.\r\nLovers and madmen have such seething brains,\r\nSuch shaping fantasies, that apprehend\r\nMore than cool reason ever comprehends.\r\nThe lunatic, the lover, and the poet\r\nAre of imagination all compact:\r\nOne sees more devils than vast hell can hold;\r\nThat is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,\r\nSees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:\r\nThe poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,\r\nDoth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;\r\nAnd as imagination bodies forth\r\nThe forms of things unknown, the poet's pen\r\nTurns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing\r\nA local habitation and a name.\r\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination,\r\nThat, if it would but apprehend some joy,\r\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy;\r\nOr in the night, imagining some fear,\r\nHow easy is a bush supposed a bear?\r\n\r\nHIPPOLYTA\r\nBut all the story of the night told over,\r\nAnd all their minds transfigur'd so together,\r\nMore witnesseth than fancy's images,\r\nAnd grows to something of great constancy;\r\nBut, howsoever, strange and admirable.\r\n\r\n[Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA.]\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nHere come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.--\r\nJoy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love\r\nAccompany your hearts!\r\n\r\nLYSANDER\r\n                       More than to us\r\nWait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nCome now; what masques, what dances shall we have,\r\nTo wear away this long age of three hours\r\nBetween our after-supper and bed-time?\r\nWhere is our usual manager of mirth?\r\nWhat revels are in hand?

It is well; leave it to his\r\ndiscretion, and let us listen to the moon.\r\n\r\nMOONSHINE\r\nThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present:\r\n\r\nDEMETRIUS\r\nHe should have worn the horns on his head.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nHe is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within\r\nthe circumference.\r\n\r\nMOONSHINE\r\nThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present;\r\nMyself the man i' the moon do seem to be.\r\n\r\nTHESEUS\r\nThis is the greatest error of all the rest: the man should be\r\nput into the lantern.

Get thee to bed, Francisco.\r\n\r\nFran.\r\nFor this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,\r\nAnd I am sick at heart.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nHave you had quiet guard?\r\n\r\nFran.\r\nNot a mouse stirring.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nWell, good night.\r\nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,\r\nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\r\n\r\nFran.\r\nI think I hear them.--Stand, ho! Who is there?\r\n\r\n[Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nFriends to this ground.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nAnd liegemen to the Dane.\r\n\r\nFran.\r\nGive you good-night.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nO, farewell, honest soldier;\r\nWho hath reliev'd you?\r\n\r\nFran.\r\nBernardo has my place.\r\nGive you good-night.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nHolla! Bernardo!\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nSay.\r\nWhat, is Horatio there?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nA piece of him.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nWelcome, Horatio:--Welcome, good Marcellus.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nWhat, has this thing appear'd again to-night?\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nI have seen nothing.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nHoratio says 'tis but our fantasy,\r\nAnd will not let belief take hold of him\r\nTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:\r\nTherefore I have entreated him along\r\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night;\r\nThat, if again this apparition come\r\nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nTush, tush, 'twill not appear.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nSit down awhile,\r\nAnd let us once again assail your ears,\r\nThat are so fortified against our story,\r\nWhat we two nights have seen.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWell, sit we down,\r\nAnd let us hear Bernardo speak of this.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nLast night of all,\r\nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole\r\nHad made his course to illume that part of heaven\r\nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,\r\nThe bell then beating one,--\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nPeace, break thee off; look where it comes again!\r\n\r\n[Enter Ghost, armed.]\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nIn the same figure, like the king that's dead.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nThou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nLooks it not like the King? mark it, Horatio.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nMost like:--it harrows me with fear and wonder.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nIt would be spoke to.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nQuestion it, Horatio.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWhat art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,\r\nTogether with that fair and warlike form\r\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark\r\nDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nIt is offended.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nSee, it stalks away!\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nStay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!\r\n\r\n[Exit Ghost.]\r\n\r\nMar.\r\n'Tis gone, and will not answer.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nHow now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:\r\nIs not this something more than fantasy?\r\nWhat think you on't?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nBefore my God, I might not this believe\r\nWithout the sensible and true avouch\r\nOf mine own eyes.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nIs it not like the King?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nAs thou art to thyself:\r\nSuch was the very armour he had on\r\nWhen he the ambitious Norway combated;\r\nSo frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,\r\nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.\r\n'Tis strange.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nThus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,\r\nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIn what particular thought to work I know not;\r\nBut, in the gross and scope of my opinion,\r\nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nGood now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,\r\nWhy this same strict and most observant watch\r\nSo nightly toils the subject of the land;\r\nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon,\r\nAnd foreign mart for implements of war;\r\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task\r\nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week;\r\nWhat might be toward, that this sweaty haste\r\nDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day:\r\nWho is't that can inform me?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nThat can I;\r\nAt least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,\r\nWhose image even but now appear'd to us,\r\nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,\r\nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\r\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,--\r\nFor so this side of our known world esteem'd him,--\r\nDid slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,\r\nWell ratified by law and heraldry,\r\nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands,\r\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:\r\nAgainst the which, a moiety competent\r\nWas gaged by our king; which had return'd\r\nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,\r\nHad he been vanquisher; as by the same cov'nant,\r\nAnd carriage of the article design'd,\r\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\r\nOf unimproved mettle hot and full,\r\nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,\r\nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\r\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise\r\nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other,--\r\nAs it doth well appear unto our state,--\r\nBut to recover of us, by strong hand,\r\nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\r\nSo by his father lost: and this, I take it,\r\nIs the main motive of our preparations,\r\nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head\r\nOf this post-haste and romage in the land.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nI think it be no other but e'en so:\r\nWell may it sort, that this portentous figure\r\nComes armed through our watch; so like the king\r\nThat was and is the question of these wars.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nA mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.\r\nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\r\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\r\nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead\r\nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;\r\nAs, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\r\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star,\r\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,\r\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:\r\nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events,--\r\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates,\r\nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,--\r\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated\r\nUnto our climature and countrymen.--\r\nBut, soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!\r\n\r\n[Re-enter Ghost.]\r\n\r\nI'll cross it, though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!\r\nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice,\r\nSpeak to me:\r\nIf there be any good thing to be done,\r\nThat may to thee do ease, and, race to me,\r\nSpeak to me:\r\nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate,\r\nWhich, happily, foreknowing may avoid,\r\nO, speak!\r\nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\r\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,\r\nFor which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\r\n[The cock crows.]\r\nSpeak of it:--stay, and speak!--Stop it, Marcellus!\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nShall I strike at it with my partisan?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nDo, if it will not stand.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\n'Tis here!\r\n\r\nHor.\r\n'Tis here!\r\n\r\nMar.\r\n'Tis gone!\r\n\r\n[Exit Ghost.]\r\n\r\nWe do it wrong, being so majestical,\r\nTo offer it the show of violence;\r\nFor it is, as the air, invulnerable,\r\nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\r\n\r\nBer.\r\nIt was about to speak, when the cock crew.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nAnd then it started, like a guilty thing\r\nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard\r\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\r\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\r\nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\r\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\r\nThe extravagant and erring spirit hies\r\nTo his confine: and of the truth herein\r\nThis present object made probation.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nIt faded on the crowing of the cock.\r\nSome say that ever 'gainst that season comes\r\nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\r\nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long;\r\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;\r\nThe nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,\r\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;\r\nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nSo have I heard, and do in part believe it.\r\nBut, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,\r\nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:\r\nBreak we our watch up: and by my advice,\r\nLet us impart what we have seen to-night\r\nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,\r\nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:\r\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\r\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning know\r\nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter the King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand,\r\nCornelius, Lords, and Attendant.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death\r\nThe memory be green, and that it us befitted\r\nTo bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom\r\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe;\r\nYet so far hath discretion fought with nature\r\nThat we with wisest sorrow think on him,\r\nTogether with remembrance of ourselves.\r\nTherefore our sometime sister, now our queen,\r\nTh' imperial jointress to this warlike state,\r\nHave we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--\r\nWith an auspicious and one dropping eye,\r\nWith mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,\r\nIn equal scale weighing delight and dole,--\r\nTaken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd\r\nYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone\r\nWith this affair along:--or all, our thanks.\r\nNow follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,\r\nHolding a weak supposal of our worth,\r\nOr thinking by our late dear brother's death\r\nOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,\r\nColleagued with this dream of his advantage,\r\nHe hath not fail'd to pester us with message,\r\nImporting the surrender of those lands\r\nLost by his father, with all bonds of law,\r\nTo our most valiant brother. So much for him,--\r\nNow for ourself and for this time of meeting:\r\nThus much the business is:--we have here writ\r\nTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--\r\nWho, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears\r\nOf this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress\r\nHis further gait herein; in that the levies,\r\nThe lists, and full proportions are all made\r\nOut of his subject:--and we here dispatch\r\nYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,\r\nFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway;\r\nGiving to you no further personal power\r\nTo business with the king, more than the scope\r\nOf these dilated articles allow.\r\nFarewell; and let your haste commend your duty.\r\n\r\nCor. and Volt.\r\nIn that and all things will we show our duty.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWe doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, Laertes, what's the news with you?\r\nYou told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?\r\nYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane,\r\nAnd lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,\r\nThat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?\r\nThe head is not more native to the heart,\r\nThe hand more instrumental to the mouth,\r\nThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father.\r\nWhat wouldst thou have, Laertes?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nDread my lord,\r\nYour leave and favour to return to France;\r\nFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark,\r\nTo show my duty in your coronation;\r\nYet now, I must confess, that duty done,\r\nMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,\r\nAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nHave you your father's leave? What says Polonius?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nHe hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\r\nBy laboursome petition; and at last\r\nUpon his will I seal'd my hard consent:\r\nI do beseech you, give him leave to go.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,\r\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will!--\r\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n[Aside.] A little more than kin, and less than kind!\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNot so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,\r\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\r\nDo not for ever with thy vailed lids\r\nSeek for thy noble father in the dust:\r\nThou know'st 'tis common,--all that lives must die,\r\nPassing through nature to eternity.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, madam, it is common.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nIf it be,\r\nWhy seems it so particular with thee?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSeems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.\r\n'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\r\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\r\nNor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,\r\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\r\nNor the dejected 'havior of the visage,\r\nTogether with all forms, moods, shows of grief,\r\nThat can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;\r\nFor they are actions that a man might play;\r\nBut I have that within which passeth show;\r\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\n'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,\r\nTo give these mourning duties to your father;\r\nBut, you must know, your father lost a father;\r\nThat father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,\r\nIn filial obligation, for some term\r\nTo do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere\r\nIn obstinate condolement is a course\r\nOf impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;\r\nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven;\r\nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient;\r\nAn understanding simple and unschool'd;\r\nFor what we know must be, and is as common\r\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,\r\nWhy should we, in our peevish opposition,\r\nTake it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,\r\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\r\nTo reason most absurd; whose common theme\r\nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\r\nFrom the first corse till he that died to-day,\r\n'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth\r\nThis unprevailing woe; and think of us\r\nAs of a father: for let the world take note\r\nYou are the most immediate to our throne;\r\nAnd with no less nobility of love\r\nThan that which dearest father bears his son\r\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent\r\nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,\r\nIt is most retrograde to our desire:\r\nAnd we beseech you bend you to remain\r\nHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\r\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:\r\nI pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI shall in all my best obey you, madam.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWhy, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:\r\nBe as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come;\r\nThis gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet\r\nSits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,\r\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day\r\nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell;\r\nAnd the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,\r\nRe-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO that this too too solid flesh would melt,\r\nThaw, and resolve itself into a dew!\r\nOr that the Everlasting had not fix'd\r\nHis canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!\r\nHow weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable\r\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\r\nFie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,\r\nThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature\r\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this!\r\nBut two months dead!--nay, not so much, not two:\r\nSo excellent a king; that was, to this,\r\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,\r\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\r\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!\r\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him\r\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\r\nBy what it fed on: and yet, within a month,--\r\nLet me not think on't,--Frailty, thy name is woman!--\r\nA little month; or ere those shoes were old\r\nWith which she followed my poor father's body\r\nLike Niobe, all tears;--why she, even she,--\r\nO God! a beast that wants discourse of reason,\r\nWould have mourn'd longer,--married with mine uncle,\r\nMy father's brother; but no more like my father\r\nThan I to Hercules: within a month;\r\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\r\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\r\nShe married:-- O, most wicked speed, to post\r\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\r\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good;\r\nBut break my heart,--for I must hold my tongue!\r\n\r\n[Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nHail to your lordship!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI am glad to see you well:\r\nHoratio,--or I do forget myself.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nThe same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:\r\nAnd what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--\r\nMarcellus?\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nMy good lord,--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI am very glad to see you.--Good even, sir.--\r\nBut what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nA truant disposition, good my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI would not hear your enemy say so;\r\nNor shall you do my ear that violence,\r\nTo make it truster of your own report\r\nAgainst yourself: I know you are no truant.\r\nBut what is your affair in Elsinore?\r\nWe'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nMy lord, I came to see your father's funeral.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.\r\nI think it was to see my mother's wedding.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIndeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats\r\nDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.\r\nWould I had met my dearest foe in heaven\r\nOr ever I had seen that day, Horatio!--\r\nMy father,--methinks I see my father.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWhere, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIn my mind's eye, Horatio.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nI saw him once; he was a goodly king.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHe was a man, take him for all in all,\r\nI shall not look upon his like again.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nMy lord, I think I saw him yesternight.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSaw who?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nMy lord, the king your father.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThe King my father!\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nSeason your admiration for awhile\r\nWith an attent ear, till I may deliver,\r\nUpon the witness of these gentlemen,\r\nThis marvel to you.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nFor God's love let me hear.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nTwo nights together had these gentlemen,\r\nMarcellus and Bernardo, on their watch\r\nIn the dead vast and middle of the night,\r\nBeen thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,\r\nArmed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,\r\nAppears before them and with solemn march\r\nGoes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd\r\nBy their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,\r\nWithin his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd\r\nAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,\r\nStand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me\r\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did;\r\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch:\r\nWhere, as they had deliver'd, both in time,\r\nForm of the thing, each word made true and good,\r\nThe apparition comes: I knew your father;\r\nThese hands are not more like.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nBut where was this?\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDid you not speak to it?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nMy lord, I did;\r\nBut answer made it none: yet once methought\r\nIt lifted up it head, and did address\r\nItself to motion, like as it would speak:\r\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\r\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\r\nAnd vanish'd from our sight.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n'Tis very strange.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nAs I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;\r\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\r\nTo let you know of it.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIndeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\r\nHold you the watch to-night?\r\n\r\nMar. and Ber.\r\nWe do, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nArm'd, say you?\r\n\r\nBoth.\r\nArm'd, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nFrom top to toe?\r\n\r\nBoth.\r\nMy lord, from head to foot.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThen saw you not his face?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nO, yes, my lord: he wore his beaver up.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat, look'd he frowningly?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nPale or red?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nNay, very pale.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAnd fix'd his eyes upon you?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nMost constantly.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI would I had been there.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIt would have much amaz'd you.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nVery like, very like. Stay'd it long?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWhile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.\r\n\r\nMar. and Ber.\r\nLonger, longer.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nNot when I saw't.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHis beard was grizzled,--no?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIt was, as I have seen it in his life,\r\nA sable silver'd.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI will watch to-night;\r\nPerchance 'twill walk again.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nI warr'nt it will.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIf it assume my noble father's person,\r\nI'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape\r\nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\r\nIf you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,\r\nLet it be tenable in your silence still;\r\nAnd whatsoever else shall hap to-night,\r\nGive it an understanding, but no tongue:\r\nI will requite your loves. So, fare ye well:\r\nUpon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,\r\nI'll visit you.\r\n\r\nAll.\r\nOur duty to your honour.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nYour loves, as mine to you: farewell.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]\r\n\r\nMy father's spirit in arms! All is not well;\r\nI doubt some foul play: would the night were come!\r\nTill then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,\r\nThough all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III. A room in Polonius's house.\r\n\r\n[Enter Laertes and Ophelia.]\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nMy necessaries are embark'd: farewell:\r\nAnd, sister, as the winds give benefit\r\nAnd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,\r\nBut let me hear from you.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nDo you doubt that?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nFor Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,\r\nHold it a fashion, and a toy in blood:\r\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\r\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;\r\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute;\r\nNo more.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nNo more but so?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nThink it no more:\r\nFor nature, crescent, does not grow alone\r\nIn thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,\r\nThe inward service of the mind and soul\r\nGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now;\r\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\r\nThe virtue of his will: but you must fear,\r\nHis greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;\r\nFor he himself is subject to his birth:\r\nHe may not, as unvalu'd persons do,\r\nCarve for himself; for on his choice depends\r\nThe safety and health of this whole state;\r\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd\r\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\r\nWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\r\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\r\nAs he in his particular act and place\r\nMay give his saying deed; which is no further\r\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\r\nThen weigh what loss your honour may sustain\r\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\r\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\r\nTo his unmaster'd importunity.\r\nFear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;\r\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\r\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\r\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\r\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon:\r\nVirtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:\r\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\r\nToo oft before their buttons be disclos'd:\r\nAnd in the morn and liquid dew of youth\r\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\r\nBe wary then; best safety lies in fear:\r\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nI shall th' effect of this good lesson keep\r\nAs watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,\r\nDo not, as some ungracious pastors do,\r\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven;\r\nWhilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,\r\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads\r\nAnd recks not his own read.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nO, fear me not.\r\nI stay too long:--but here my father comes.\r\n\r\n[Enter Polonius.]\r\n\r\nA double blessing is a double grace;\r\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nYet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!\r\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\r\nAnd you are stay'd for. There,--my blessing with thee!\r\n\r\n[Laying his hand on Laertes's head.]\r\n\r\nAnd these few precepts in thy memory\r\nLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\r\nNor any unproportion'd thought his act.\r\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\r\nThose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\r\nGrapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;\r\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\r\nOf each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware\r\nOf entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,\r\nBear't that the opposed may beware of thee.\r\nGive every man thine ear, but few thy voice:\r\nTake each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.\r\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\r\nBut not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:\r\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man;\r\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\r\nAre most select and generous chief in that.\r\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be:\r\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend;\r\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\r\nThis above all,--to thine own self be true;\r\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\r\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\r\nFarewell: my blessing season this in thee!\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nThe time invites you; go, your servants tend.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nFarewell, Ophelia; and remember well\r\nWhat I have said to you.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\n'Tis in my memory lock'd,\r\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nWhat is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nSo please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nMarry, well bethought:\r\n'Tis told me he hath very oft of late\r\nGiven private time to you; and you yourself\r\nHave of your audience been most free and bounteous;\r\nIf it be so,--as so 'tis put on me,\r\nAnd that in way of caution,--I must tell you\r\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\r\nAs it behooves my daughter and your honour.\r\nWhat is between you? give me up the truth.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nHe hath, my lord, of late made many tenders\r\nOf his affection to me.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nAffection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,\r\nUnsifted in such perilous circumstance.\r\nDo you believe his tenders, as you call them?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nI do not know, my lord, what I should think.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nMarry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;\r\nThat you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,\r\nWhich are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;\r\nOr,--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\r\nWronging it thus,--you'll tender me a fool.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nMy lord, he hath importun'd me with love\r\nIn honourable fashion.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\r\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\r\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\r\nLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,\r\nGiving more light than heat,--extinct in both,\r\nEven in their promise, as it is a-making,--\r\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\r\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence;\r\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\r\nThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\r\nBelieve so much in him, that he is young;\r\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\r\nThan may be given you: in few, Ophelia,\r\nDo not believe his vows; for they are brokers,--\r\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\r\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\r\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds,\r\nThe better to beguile. This is for all,--\r\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\r\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\r\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\r\nLook to't, I charge you; come your ways.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nI shall obey, my lord.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV. The platform.\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThe air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIt is a nipping and an eager air.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat hour now?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nI think it lacks of twelve.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nNo, it is struck.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIndeed? I heard it not: then draws near the season\r\nWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.\r\n\r\n[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within.]\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThe King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,\r\nKeeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;\r\nAnd, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,\r\nThe kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out\r\nThe triumph of his pledge.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIs it a custom?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, marry, is't;\r\nBut to my mind,--though I am native here,\r\nAnd to the manner born,--it is a custom\r\nMore honour'd in the breach than the observance.\r\nThis heavy-headed revel east and west\r\nMakes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations:\r\nThey clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase\r\nSoil our addition; and, indeed, it takes\r\nFrom our achievements, though perform'd at height,\r\nThe pith and marrow of our attribute.\r\nSo oft it chances in particular men\r\nThat, for some vicious mole of nature in them,\r\nAs in their birth,--wherein they are not guilty,\r\nSince nature cannot choose his origin,--\r\nBy the o'ergrowth of some complexion,\r\nOft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;\r\nOr by some habit, that too much o'er-leavens\r\nThe form of plausive manners;--that these men,--\r\nCarrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,\r\nBeing nature's livery, or fortune's star,--\r\nTheir virtues else,--be they as pure as grace,\r\nAs infinite as man may undergo,--\r\nShall in the general censure take corruption\r\nFrom that particular fault: the dram of eale\r\nDoth all the noble substance often doubt\r\nTo his own scandal.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nLook, my lord, it comes!\r\n\r\n[Enter Ghost.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAngels and ministers of grace defend us!--\r\nBe thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,\r\nBring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,\r\nBe thy intents wicked or charitable,\r\nThou com'st in such a questionable shape\r\nThat I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,\r\nKing, father, royal Dane; O, answer me!\r\nLet me not burst in ignorance; but tell\r\nWhy thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,\r\nHave burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,\r\nWherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,\r\nHath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws\r\nTo cast thee up again! What may this mean,\r\nThat thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,\r\nRevisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,\r\nMaking night hideous, and we fools of nature\r\nSo horridly to shake our disposition\r\nWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?\r\nSay, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?\r\n\r\n[Ghost beckons Hamlet.]\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIt beckons you to go away with it,\r\nAs if it some impartment did desire\r\nTo you alone.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nLook with what courteous action\r\nIt waves you to a more removed ground:\r\nBut do not go with it!\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nNo, by no means.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIt will not speak; then will I follow it.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nDo not, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, what should be the fear?\r\nI do not set my life at a pin's fee;\r\nAnd for my soul, what can it do to that,\r\nBeing a thing immortal as itself?\r\nIt waves me forth again;--I'll follow it.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWhat if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,\r\nOr to the dreadful summit of the cliff\r\nThat beetles o'er his base into the sea,\r\nAnd there assume some other horrible form\r\nWhich might deprive your sovereignty of reason,\r\nAnd draw you into madness? think of it:\r\nThe very place puts toys of desperation,\r\nWithout more motive, into every brain\r\nThat looks so many fadoms to the sea\r\nAnd hears it roar beneath.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIt waves me still.--\r\nGo on; I'll follow thee.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nYou shall not go, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHold off your hands.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nBe rul'd; you shall not go.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMy fate cries out,\r\nAnd makes each petty artery in this body\r\nAs hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.--\r\n\r\n[Ghost beckons.]\r\n\r\nStill am I call'd;--unhand me, gentlemen;--\r\n\r\n[Breaking free from them.]\r\n\r\nBy heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!--\r\nI say, away!--Go on; I'll follow thee.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.]\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nHe waxes desperate with imagination.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nLet's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nHave after.--To what issue will this come?\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nHeaven will direct it.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nNay, let's follow him.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene V. A more remote part of the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter Ghost and Hamlet.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhither wilt thou lead me? speak! I'll go no further.\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\nMark me.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI will.\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\nMy hour is almost come,\r\nWhen I to sulph'uous and tormenting flames\r\nMust render up myself.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAlas, poor ghost!\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\nPity me not, but lend thy serious hearing\r\nTo what I shall unfold.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSpeak; I am bound to hear.\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\nSo art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\nI am thy father's spirit;\r\nDoom'd for a certain term to walk the night,\r\nAnd for the day confin'd to wastein fires,\r\nTill the foul crimes done in my days of nature\r\nAre burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid\r\nTo tell the secrets of my prison-house,\r\nI could a tale unfold whose lightest word\r\nWould harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;\r\nMake thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;\r\nThy knotted and combined locks to part,\r\nAnd each particular hair to stand on end\r\nLike quills upon the fretful porcupine:\r\nBut this eternal blazon must not be\r\nTo ears of flesh and blood.--List, list, O, list!--\r\nIf thou didst ever thy dear father love--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO God!\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\nRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMurder!\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\nMurder most foul, as in the best it is;\r\nBut this most foul, strange, and unnatural.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHaste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift\r\nAs meditation or the thoughts of love,\r\nMay sweep to my revenge.\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\nI find thee apt;\r\nAnd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed\r\nThat rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,\r\nWouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.\r\n'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\r\nA serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark\r\nIs by a forged process of my death\r\nRankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,\r\nThe serpent that did sting thy father's life\r\nNow wears his crown.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO my prophetic soul!\r\nMine uncle!\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\nAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\r\nWith witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--\r\nO wicked wit and gifts, that have the power\r\nSo to seduce!--won to his shameful lust\r\nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:\r\nO Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!\r\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity\r\nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow\r\nI made to her in marriage; and to decline\r\nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\r\nTo those of mine!\r\nBut virtue, as it never will be mov'd,\r\nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;\r\nSo lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,\r\nWill sate itself in a celestial bed\r\nAnd prey on garbage.\r\nBut soft! methinks I scent the morning air;\r\nBrief let me be.--Sleeping within my orchard,\r\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\r\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole,\r\nWith juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,\r\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\r\nThe leperous distilment; whose effect\r\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\r\nThat, swift as quicksilver, it courses through\r\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body;\r\nAnd with a sudden vigour it doth posset\r\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\r\nThe thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;\r\nAnd a most instant tetter bark'd about,\r\nMost lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust\r\nAll my smooth body.\r\nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,\r\nOf life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:\r\nCut off even in the blossoms of my sin,\r\nUnhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;\r\nNo reckoning made, but sent to my account\r\nWith all my imperfections on my head:\r\nO, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!\r\nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;\r\nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be\r\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.\r\nBut, howsoever thou pursu'st this act,\r\nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\r\nAgainst thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,\r\nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,\r\nTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!\r\nThe glowworm shows the matin to be near,\r\nAnd 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:\r\nAdieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?\r\nAnd shall I couple hell? O, fie!--Hold, my heart;\r\nAnd you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\r\nBut bear me stiffly up.--Remember thee!\r\nAy, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat\r\nIn this distracted globe. Remember thee!\r\nYea, from the table of my memory\r\nI'll wipe away all trivial fond records,\r\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\r\nThat youth and observation copied there;\r\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live\r\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\r\nUnmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!--\r\nO most pernicious woman!\r\nO villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!\r\nMy tables,--meet it is I set it down,\r\nThat one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;\r\nAt least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark:\r\n\r\n[Writing.]\r\n\r\nSo, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;\r\nIt is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me:'\r\nI have sworn't.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\n[Within.] My lord, my lord,--\r\n\r\nMar.\r\n[Within.] Lord Hamlet,--\r\n\r\nHor.\r\n[Within.] Heaven secure him!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSo be it!\r\n\r\nMar.\r\n[Within.] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.\r\n\r\n[Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nHow is't, my noble lord?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWhat news, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO, wonderful!\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nGood my lord, tell it.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNo; you'll reveal it.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nNot I, my lord, by heaven.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nNor I, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow say you then; would heart of man once think it?--\r\nBut you'll be secret?\r\n\r\nHor. and Mar.\r\nAy, by heaven, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThere's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark\r\nBut he's an arrant knave.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave\r\nTo tell us this.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, right; you are i' the right;\r\nAnd so, without more circumstance at all,\r\nI hold it fit that we shake hands and part:\r\nYou, as your business and desires shall point you,--\r\nFor every man hath business and desire,\r\nSuch as it is;--and for my own poor part,\r\nLook you, I'll go pray.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nThese are but wild and whirling words, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI'm sorry they offend you, heartily;\r\nYes, faith, heartily.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nThere's no offence, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nYes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,\r\nAnd much offence too. Touching this vision here,--\r\nIt is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:\r\nFor your desire to know what is between us,\r\nO'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,\r\nAs you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,\r\nGive me one poor request.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWhat is't, my lord? we will.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNever make known what you have seen to-night.\r\n\r\nHor. and Mar.\r\nMy lord, we will not.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNay, but swear't.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIn faith,\r\nMy lord, not I.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nNor I, my lord, in faith.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nUpon my sword.\r\n\r\nMar.\r\nWe have sworn, my lord, already.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIndeed, upon my sword, indeed.\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\n[Beneath.] Swear.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHa, ha boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny?--\r\nCome on!--you hear this fellow in the cellarage,--\r\nConsent to swear.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nPropose the oath, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNever to speak of this that you have seen,\r\nSwear by my sword.\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\n[Beneath.] Swear.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.--\r\nCome hither, gentlemen,\r\nAnd lay your hands again upon my sword:\r\nNever to speak of this that you have heard,\r\nSwear by my sword.\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\n[Beneath.] Swear.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWell said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?\r\nA worthy pioner!--Once more remove, good friends.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nO day and night, but this is wondrous strange!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAnd therefore as a stranger give it welcome.\r\nThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\r\nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy.\r\nBut come;--\r\nHere, as before, never, so help you mercy,\r\nHow strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,--\r\nAs I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet\r\nTo put an antic disposition on,--\r\nThat you, at such times seeing me, never shall,\r\nWith arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,\r\nOr by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,\r\nAs 'Well, well, we know'; or 'We could, an if we would';--\r\nOr 'If we list to speak'; or 'There be, an if they might';--\r\nOr such ambiguous giving out, to note\r\nThat you know aught of me:--this is not to do,\r\nSo grace and mercy at your most need help you,\r\nSwear.\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\n[Beneath.] Swear.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nRest, rest, perturbed spirit!--So, gentlemen,\r\nWith all my love I do commend me to you:\r\nAnd what so poor a man as Hamlet is\r\nMay do, to express his love and friending to you,\r\nGod willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;\r\nAnd still your fingers on your lips, I pray.\r\nThe time is out of joint:--O cursed spite,\r\nThat ever I was born to set it right!--\r\nNay, come, let's go together.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct II.\r\n\r\nScene I. A room in Polonius's house.\r\n\r\n[Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nGive him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nI will, my lord.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nYou shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,\r\nBefore You visit him, to make inquiry\r\nOf his behaviour.\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nMy lord, I did intend it.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nMarry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,\r\nEnquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;\r\nAnd how, and who, what means, and where they keep,\r\nWhat company, at what expense; and finding,\r\nBy this encompassment and drift of question,\r\nThat they do know my son, come you more nearer\r\nThan your particular demands will touch it:\r\nTake you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;\r\nAs thus, 'I know his father and his friends,\r\nAnd in part him;--do you mark this, Reynaldo?\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nAy, very well, my lord.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\n'And in part him;--but,' you may say, 'not well:\r\nBut if't be he I mean, he's very wild;\r\nAddicted so and so;' and there put on him\r\nWhat forgeries you please; marry, none so rank\r\nAs may dishonour him; take heed of that;\r\nBut, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips\r\nAs are companions noted and most known\r\nTo youth and liberty.\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nAs gaming, my lord.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nAy, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,\r\nDrabbing:--you may go so far.\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nMy lord, that would dishonour him.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nFaith, no; as you may season it in the charge.\r\nYou must not put another scandal on him,\r\nThat he is open to incontinency;\r\nThat's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly\r\nThat they may seem the taints of liberty;\r\nThe flash and outbreak of a fiery mind;\r\nA savageness in unreclaimed blood,\r\nOf general assault.\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nBut, my good lord,--\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nWherefore should you do this?\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nAy, my lord,\r\nI would know that.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nMarry, sir, here's my drift;\r\nAnd I believe it is a fetch of warrant:\r\nYou laying these slight sullies on my son\r\nAs 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,\r\nMark you,\r\nYour party in converse, him you would sound,\r\nHaving ever seen in the prenominate crimes\r\nThe youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd\r\nHe closes with you in this consequence;\r\n'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'--\r\nAccording to the phrase or the addition\r\nOf man and country.\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nVery good, my lord.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nAnd then, sir, does he this,--he does--What was I about to say?--\r\nBy the mass, I was about to say something:--Where did I leave?\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nAt 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and\r\ngentleman.'\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nAt--closes in the consequence'--ay, marry!\r\nHe closes with you thus:--'I know the gentleman;\r\nI saw him yesterday, or t'other day,\r\nOr then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,\r\nThere was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;\r\nThere falling out at tennis': or perchance,\r\n'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'--\r\nVidelicet, a brothel,--or so forth.--\r\nSee you now;\r\nYour bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:\r\nAnd thus do we of wisdom and of reach,\r\nWith windlaces, and with assays of bias,\r\nBy indirections find directions out:\r\nSo, by my former lecture and advice,\r\nShall you my son. You have me, have you not?\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nMy lord, I have.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nGod b' wi' you, fare you well.\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nGood my lord!\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nObserve his inclination in yourself.\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nI shall, my lord.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nAnd let him ply his music.\r\n\r\nRey.\r\nWell, my lord.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nFarewell!\r\n\r\n[Exit Reynaldo.]\r\n\r\n[Enter Ophelia.]\r\n\r\nHow now, Ophelia! what's the matter?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nAlas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nWith what, i' the name of God?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nMy lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,\r\nLord Hamlet,--with his doublet all unbrac'd;\r\nNo hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,\r\nUngart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;\r\nPale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;\r\nAnd with a look so piteous in purport\r\nAs if he had been loosed out of hell\r\nTo speak of horrors,--he comes before me.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nMad for thy love?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nMy lord, I do not know;\r\nBut truly I do fear it.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nWhat said he?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nHe took me by the wrist, and held me hard;\r\nThen goes he to the length of all his arm;\r\nAnd with his other hand thus o'er his brow,\r\nHe falls to such perusal of my face\r\nAs he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;\r\nAt last,--a little shaking of mine arm,\r\nAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,--\r\nHe rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound\r\nAs it did seem to shatter all his bulk\r\nAnd end his being: that done, he lets me go:\r\nAnd, with his head over his shoulder turn'd\r\nHe seem'd to find his way without his eyes;\r\nFor out o' doors he went without their help,\r\nAnd to the last bended their light on me.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nCome, go with me: I will go seek the king.\r\nThis is the very ecstasy of love;\r\nWhose violent property fordoes itself,\r\nAnd leads the will to desperate undertakings,\r\nAs oft as any passion under heaven\r\nThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry,--\r\nWhat, have you given him any hard words of late?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nNo, my good lord; but, as you did command,\r\nI did repel his letters and denied\r\nHis access to me.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nThat hath made him mad.\r\nI am sorry that with better heed and judgment\r\nI had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,\r\nAnd meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy!\r\nIt seems it as proper to our age\r\nTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinions\r\nAs it is common for the younger sort\r\nTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:\r\nThis must be known; which, being kept close, might move\r\nMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II. A room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter King, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWelcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!\r\nMoreover that we much did long to see you,\r\nThe need we have to use you did provoke\r\nOur hasty sending. Something have you heard\r\nOf Hamlet's transformation; so I call it,\r\nSince nor the exterior nor the inward man\r\nResembles that it was. What it should be,\r\nMore than his father's death, that thus hath put him\r\nSo much from the understanding of himself,\r\nI cannot dream of: I entreat you both\r\nThat, being of so young days brought up with him,\r\nAnd since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,\r\nThat you vouchsafe your rest here in our court\r\nSome little time: so by your companies\r\nTo draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,\r\nSo much as from occasion you may glean,\r\nWhether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,\r\nThat, open'd, lies within our remedy.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nGood gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,\r\nAnd sure I am two men there are not living\r\nTo whom he more adheres. If it will please you\r\nTo show us so much gentry and good-will\r\nAs to expend your time with us awhile,\r\nFor the supply and profit of our hope,\r\nYour visitation shall receive such thanks\r\nAs fits a king's remembrance.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nBoth your majesties\r\nMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,\r\nPut your dread pleasures more into command\r\nThan to entreaty.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nWe both obey,\r\nAnd here give up ourselves, in the full bent,\r\nTo lay our service freely at your feet,\r\nTo be commanded.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nThanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nThanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:\r\nAnd I beseech you instantly to visit\r\nMy too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you,\r\nAnd bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nHeavens make our presence and our practices\r\nPleasant and helpful to him!\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nAy, amen!\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants].\r\n\r\n[Enter Polonius.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nTh' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,\r\nAre joyfully return'd.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nThou still hast been the father of good news.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nHave I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,\r\nI hold my duty, as I hold my soul,\r\nBoth to my God and to my gracious king:\r\nAnd I do think,--or else this brain of mine\r\nHunts not the trail of policy so sure\r\nAs it hath us'd to do,--that I have found\r\nThe very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nO, speak of that; that do I long to hear.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nGive first admittance to the ambassadors;\r\nMy news shall be the fruit to that great feast.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nThyself do grace to them, and bring them in.\r\n\r\n[Exit Polonius.]\r\n\r\nHe tells me, my sweet queen, he hath found\r\nThe head and source of all your son's distemper.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nI doubt it is no other but the main,--\r\nHis father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWell, we shall sift him.\r\n\r\n[Enter Polonius, with Voltimand and Cornelius.]\r\n\r\nWelcome, my good friends!\r\nSay, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?\r\n\r\nVolt.\r\nMost fair return of greetings and desires.\r\nUpon our first, he sent out to suppress\r\nHis nephew's levies; which to him appear'd\r\nTo be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;\r\nBut, better look'd into, he truly found\r\nIt was against your highness; whereat griev'd,--\r\nThat so his sickness, age, and impotence\r\nWas falsely borne in hand,--sends out arrests\r\nOn Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;\r\nReceives rebuke from Norway; and, in fine,\r\nMakes vow before his uncle never more\r\nTo give th' assay of arms against your majesty.\r\nWhereon old Norway, overcome with joy,\r\nGives him three thousand crowns in annual fee;\r\nAnd his commission to employ those soldiers,\r\nSo levied as before, against the Polack:\r\nWith an entreaty, herein further shown,\r\n[Gives a paper.]\r\nThat it might please you to give quiet pass\r\nThrough your dominions for this enterprise,\r\nOn such regards of safety and allowance\r\nAs therein are set down.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nIt likes us well;\r\nAnd at our more consider'd time we'll read,\r\nAnswer, and think upon this business.\r\nMeantime we thank you for your well-took labour:\r\nGo to your rest; at night we'll feast together:\r\nMost welcome home!\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nThis business is well ended.--\r\nMy liege, and madam,--to expostulate\r\nWhat majesty should be, what duty is,\r\nWhy day is day, night is night, and time is time.\r\nWere nothing but to waste night, day, and time.\r\nTherefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,\r\nAnd tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,\r\nI will be brief:--your noble son is mad:\r\nMad call I it; for to define true madness,\r\nWhat is't but to be nothing else but mad?\r\nBut let that go.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nMore matter, with less art.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nMadam, I swear I use no art at all.\r\nThat he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;\r\nAnd pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;\r\nBut farewell it, for I will use no art.\r\nMad let us grant him then: and now remains\r\nThat we find out the cause of this effect;\r\nOr rather say, the cause of this defect,\r\nFor this effect defective comes by cause:\r\nThus it remains, and the remainder thus.\r\nPerpend.\r\nI have a daughter,--have whilst she is mine,--\r\nWho, in her duty and obedience, mark,\r\nHath given me this: now gather, and surmise.\r\n[Reads.]\r\n'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified\r\nOphelia,'--\r\nThat's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile\r\nphrase: but you shall hear. Thus:\r\n[Reads.]\r\n'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nCame this from Hamlet to her?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nGood madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.\r\n[Reads.]\r\n  'Doubt thou the stars are fire;\r\n     Doubt that the sun doth move;\r\n   Doubt truth to be a liar;\r\n     But never doubt I love.\r\n'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to\r\nreckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe\r\nit. Adieu.\r\n  'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,\r\n     HAMLET.'\r\nThis, in obedience, hath my daughter show'd me;\r\nAnd more above, hath his solicitings,\r\nAs they fell out by time, by means, and place,\r\nAll given to mine ear.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nBut how hath she\r\nReceiv'd his love?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nWhat do you think of me?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nAs of a man faithful and honourable.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nI would fain prove so. But what might you think,\r\nWhen I had seen this hot love on the wing,--\r\nAs I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,\r\nBefore my daughter told me,-- what might you,\r\nOr my dear majesty your queen here, think,\r\nIf I had play'd the desk or table-book,\r\nOr given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;\r\nOr look'd upon this love with idle sight;--\r\nWhat might you think? No, I went round to work,\r\nAnd my young mistress thus I did bespeak:\r\n'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;\r\nThis must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,\r\nThat she should lock herself from his resort,\r\nAdmit no messengers, receive no tokens.\r\nWhich done, she took the fruits of my advice;\r\nAnd he, repulsed,--a short tale to make,--\r\nFell into a sadness; then into a fast;\r\nThence to a watch; thence into a weakness;\r\nThence to a lightness; and, by this declension,\r\nInto the madness wherein now he raves,\r\nAnd all we wail for.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nDo you think 'tis this?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nIt may be, very likely.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nHath there been such a time,--I'd fain know that--\r\nThat I have positively said ''Tis so,'\r\nWhen it prov'd otherwise?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nNot that I know.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nTake this from this, if this be otherwise:\r\n[Points to his head and shoulder.]\r\nIf circumstances lead me, I will find\r\nWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeed\r\nWithin the centre.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nHow may we try it further?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nYou know sometimes he walks for hours together\r\nHere in the lobby.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nSo he does indeed.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nAt such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:\r\nBe you and I behind an arras then;\r\nMark the encounter: if he love her not,\r\nAnd he not from his reason fall'n thereon\r\nLet me be no assistant for a state,\r\nBut keep a farm and carters.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWe will try it.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nBut look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nAway, I do beseech you, both away\r\nI'll board him presently:--O, give me leave.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.]\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet, reading.]\r\n\r\nHow does my good Lord Hamlet?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWell, God-a-mercy.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nDo you know me, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nExcellent well; you're a fishmonger.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nNot I, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThen I would you were so honest a man.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nHonest, my lord!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man\r\npicked out of ten thousand.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nThat's very true, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nFor if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god-kissing\r\ncarrion,--Have you a daughter?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nI have, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nLet her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing, but not\r\nas your daughter may conceive:--friend, look to't.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nHow say you by that?--[Aside.] Still harping on my daughter:--yet\r\nhe knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far\r\ngone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity\r\nfor love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.--What do you\r\nread, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWords, words, words.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nWhat is the matter, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nBetween who?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nI mean, the matter that you read, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSlanders, sir: for the satirical slave says here that old men\r\nhave grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes\r\npurging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a\r\nplentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which,\r\nsir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it\r\nnot honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,\r\nshould be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\n[Aside.] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.--\r\nWill you walk out of the air, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nInto my grave?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nIndeed, that is out o' the air. [Aside.] How pregnant sometimes\r\nhis replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which\r\nreason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I\r\nwill leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between\r\nhim and my daughter.--My honourable lord, I will most humbly take\r\nmy leave of you.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nYou cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more\r\nwillingly part withal,--except my life, except my life, except my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nFare you well, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThese tedious old fools!\r\n\r\n[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nYou go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\n[To Polonius.] God save you, sir!\r\n\r\n[Exit Polonius.]\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nMy honoured lord!\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nMy most dear lord!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMy excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,\r\nRosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nHappy in that we are not over-happy;\r\nOn fortune's cap we are not the very button.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNor the soles of her shoe?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nNeither, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThen you live about her waist, or in the middle of her\r\nfavours?\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nFaith, her privates we.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIn the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a\r\nstrumpet. What's the news?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nNone, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThen is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me\r\nquestion more in particular: what have you, my good friends,\r\ndeserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison\r\nhither?\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nPrison, my lord!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDenmark's a prison.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nThen is the world one.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nA goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and\r\ndungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nWe think not so, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good\r\nor bad but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nWhy, then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a\r\nking of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nWhich dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of\r\nthe ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nA dream itself is but a shadow.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that\r\nit is but a shadow's shadow.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd\r\nheroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my\r\nfay, I cannot reason.\r\n\r\nRos. and Guild.\r\nWe'll wait upon you.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNo such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my\r\nservants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most\r\ndreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what\r\nmake you at Elsinore?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nTo visit you, my lord; no other occasion.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:\r\nand sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were\r\nyou not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free\r\nvisitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nWhat should we say, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, anything--but to the purpose. You were sent for; and\r\nthere is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties\r\nhave not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen\r\nhave sent for you.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nTo what end, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights\r\nof our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the\r\nobligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a\r\nbetter proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with\r\nme, whether you were sent for or no.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\n[To Guildenstern.] What say you?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n[Aside.] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you love me, hold\r\nnot off.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nMy lord, we were sent for.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your\r\ndiscovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no\r\nfeather. I have of late,--but wherefore I know not,--lost all my\r\nmirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so\r\nheavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,\r\nseems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the\r\nair, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical\r\nroof fretted with golden fire,--why, it appears no other thing\r\nto me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a\r\npiece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in\r\nfaculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in\r\naction how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the\r\nbeauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what\r\nis this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman\r\nneither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten\r\nentertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them\r\non the way; and hither are they coming to offer you service.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHe that plays the king shall be welcome,--his majesty shall\r\nhave tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and\r\ntarget; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall\r\nend his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose\r\nlungs are tickle o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind\r\nfreely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are\r\nthey?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nEven those you were wont to take such delight in,--the\r\ntragedians of the city.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow chances it they travel? their residence, both in\r\nreputation and profit, was better both ways.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nI think their inhibition comes by the means of the late\r\ninnovation.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDo they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the\r\ncity? Are they so followed?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nNo, indeed, are they not.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow comes it? do they grow rusty?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,\r\nsir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top\r\nof question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are\r\nnow the fashion; and so berattle the common stages,--so they call\r\nthem,--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and\r\ndare scarce come thither.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat, are they children? who maintains 'em? How are they\r\nescoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can\r\nsing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow\r\nthemselves to common players,--as it is most like, if their means\r\nare no better,--their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim\r\nagainst their own succession?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nFaith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation\r\nholds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for\r\nawhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player\r\nwent to cuffs in the question.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIs't possible?\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nO, there has been much throwing about of brains.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDo the boys carry it away?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nAy, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIt is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark, and\r\nthose that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give\r\ntwenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in\r\nlittle. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if\r\nphilosophy could find it out.\r\n\r\n[Flourish of trumpets within.]\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nThere are the players.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come: the\r\nappurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply\r\nwith you in this garb; lest my extent to the players, which I\r\ntell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like\r\nentertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father\r\nand aunt-mother are deceived.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nIn what, my dear lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I\r\nknow a hawk from a handsaw.\r\n\r\n[Enter Polonius.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nWell be with you, gentlemen!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHark you, Guildenstern;--and you too;--at each ear a hearer: that\r\ngreat baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nHappily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old\r\nman is twice a child.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.--You\r\nsay right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMy lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in\r\nRome,--\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nThe actors are come hither, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nBuzz, buzz!\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nUpon my honour,--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThen came each actor on his ass,--\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,\r\nhistory, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,\r\ntragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene\r\nindividable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy nor\r\nPlautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are\r\nthe only men.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nWhat treasure had he, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy--\r\n   'One fair daughter, and no more,\r\n   The which he loved passing well.'\r\n\r\n\r\nPol.\r\n[Aside.] Still on my daughter.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAm I not i' the right, old Jephthah?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nIf you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I\r\nlove passing well.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNay, that follows not.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nWhat follows, then, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy--\r\n   'As by lot, God wot,'\r\nand then, you know,\r\n   'It came to pass, as most like it was--'\r\nThe first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look\r\nwhere my abridgment comes.\r\n\r\n[Enter four or five Players.]\r\n\r\nYou are welcome, masters; welcome, all:--I am glad to see thee\r\nwell.--welcome, good friends.--O, my old friend! Thy face is\r\nvalanc'd since I saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in\r\nDenmark?--What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your\r\nladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the\r\naltitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of\r\nuncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring.--Masters, you are\r\nall welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at\r\nanything we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a\r\ntaste of your quality: come, a passionate speech.\r\n\r\nI Play.\r\nWhat speech, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI heard thee speak me a speech once,--but it was never acted;\r\nor if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased\r\nnot the million, 'twas caviare to the general; but it was,--as I\r\nreceived it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in\r\nthe top of mine,--an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,\r\nset down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said\r\nthere were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,\r\nnor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of\r\naffectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as\r\nsweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it\r\nI chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it\r\nespecially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in\r\nyour memory, begin at this line;--let me see, let me see:--\r\n\r\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,--\r\n\r\nit is not so:-- it begins with Pyrrhus:--\r\n\r\n  'The rugged Pyrrhus,--he whose sable arms,\r\n   Black as his purpose, did the night resemble\r\n   When he lay couched in the ominous horse,--\r\n   Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd\r\n   With heraldry more dismal; head to foot\r\n   Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd\r\n   With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\r\n   Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,\r\n   That lend a tyrannous and a damned light\r\n   To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,\r\n   And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,\r\n   With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\r\n   Old grandsire Priam seeks.'\r\n\r\nSo, proceed you.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\n'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nI Play.\r\n   Anon he finds him,\r\n   Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,\r\n   Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\r\n   Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,\r\n   Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;\r\n   But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\r\n   The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\r\n   Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\r\n   Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash\r\n   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,\r\n   Which was declining on the milky head\r\n   Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:\r\n   So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;\r\n   And, like a neutral to his will and matter,\r\n   Did nothing.\r\n   But as we often see, against some storm,\r\n   A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\r\n   The bold winds speechless, and the orb below\r\n   As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\r\n   Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\r\n   A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;\r\n   And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\r\n   On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,\r\n   With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\r\n   Now falls on Priam.--\r\n   Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,\r\n   In general synod, take away her power;\r\n   Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\r\n   And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\r\n   As low as to the fiends!\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nThis is too long.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIt shall to the barber's, with your beard.--Pr'ythee say on.--\r\nHe's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps:--say on; come\r\nto Hecuba.\r\n\r\nI Play.\r\n   But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n'The mobled queen'?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nThat's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.\r\n\r\nI Play.\r\n   Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames\r\n   With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head\r\n   Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\r\n   About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,\r\n   A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;--\r\n   Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,\r\n   'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:\r\n   But if the gods themselves did see her then,\r\n   When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\r\n   In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,\r\n   The instant burst of clamour that she made,--\r\n   Unless things mortal move them not at all,--\r\n   Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,\r\n   And passion in the gods.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nLook, whether he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's\r\neyes.--Pray you, no more!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.--\r\nGood my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you\r\nhear? Let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief\r\nchronicles of the time; after your death you were better have a\r\nbad epitaph than their ill report while you live.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nOdd's bodikin, man, better: use every man after his\r\ndesert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own\r\nhonour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in\r\nyour bounty. Take them in.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nCome, sirs.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nFollow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First.]\r\n\r\nDost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murder of\r\nGonzago'?\r\n\r\nI Play.\r\nAy, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWe'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a\r\nspeech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and\r\ninsert in't? could you not?\r\n\r\nI Play.\r\nAy, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nVery well.--Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.\r\n\r\n[Exit First Player.]\r\n\r\n--My good friends [to Ros. and Guild.], I'll leave you till\r\nnight: you are welcome to Elsinore.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nGood my lord!\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, so, God b' wi' ye!\r\nNow I am alone.\r\nO, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\r\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\r\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\r\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\r\nThat from her working all his visage wan'd;\r\nTears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,\r\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\r\nWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!\r\nFor Hecuba?\r\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\r\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do,\r\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\r\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\r\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech;\r\nMake mad the guilty, and appal the free;\r\nConfound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,\r\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears.\r\nYet I,\r\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,\r\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\r\nAnd can say nothing; no, not for a king\r\nUpon whose property and most dear life\r\nA damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?\r\nWho calls me villain? breaks my pate across?\r\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?\r\nTweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat\r\nAs deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?\r\n'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be\r\nBut I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall\r\nTo make oppression bitter; or ere this\r\nI should have fatted all the region kites\r\nWith this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!\r\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!\r\nO, vengeance!\r\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\r\nThat I, the son of a dear father murder'd,\r\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\r\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words\r\nAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,\r\nA scullion!\r\nFie upon't! foh!--About, my brain! I have heard\r\nThat guilty creatures, sitting at a play,\r\nHave by the very cunning of the scene\r\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\r\nThey have proclaim'd their malefactions;\r\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\r\nWith most miraculous organ, I'll have these players\r\nPlay something like the murder of my father\r\nBefore mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;\r\nI'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,\r\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\r\nMay be the devil: and the devil hath power\r\nTo assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps\r\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,--\r\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,--\r\nAbuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds\r\nMore relative than this.--the play's the thing\r\nWherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT III.\r\n\r\nScene I. A room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and\r\nGuildenstern.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nAnd can you, by no drift of circumstance,\r\nGet from him why he puts on this confusion,\r\nGrating so harshly all his days of quiet\r\nWith turbulent and dangerous lunacy?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nHe does confess he feels himself distracted,\r\nBut from what cause he will by no means speak.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nNor do we find him forward to be sounded,\r\nBut, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof\r\nWhen we would bring him on to some confession\r\nOf his true state.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nDid he receive you well?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nMost like a gentleman.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nBut with much forcing of his disposition.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nNiggard of question; but, of our demands,\r\nMost free in his reply.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nDid you assay him\r\nTo any pastime?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nMadam, it so fell out that certain players\r\nWe o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him,\r\nAnd there did seem in him a kind of joy\r\nTo hear of it: they are about the court,\r\nAnd, as I think, they have already order\r\nThis night to play before him.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\n'Tis most true;\r\nAnd he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties\r\nTo hear and see the matter.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWith all my heart; and it doth much content me\r\nTo hear him so inclin'd.--\r\nGood gentlemen, give him a further edge,\r\nAnd drive his purpose on to these delights.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nWe shall, my lord.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nSweet Gertrude, leave us too;\r\nFor we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,\r\nThat he, as 'twere by accident, may here\r\nAffront Ophelia:\r\nHer father and myself,--lawful espials,--\r\nWill so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,\r\nWe may of their encounter frankly judge;\r\nAnd gather by him, as he is behav'd,\r\nIf't be the affliction of his love or no\r\nThat thus he suffers for.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nI shall obey you:--\r\nAnd for your part, Ophelia, I do wish\r\nThat your good beauties be the happy cause\r\nOf Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues\r\nWill bring him to his wonted way again,\r\nTo both your honours.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nMadam, I wish it may.\r\n\r\n[Exit Queen.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nOphelia, walk you here.--Gracious, so please you,\r\nWe will bestow ourselves.--[To Ophelia.] Read on this book;\r\nThat show of such an exercise may colour\r\nYour loneliness.--We are oft to blame in this,--\r\n'Tis too much prov'd,--that with devotion's visage\r\nAnd pious action we do sugar o'er\r\nThe Devil himself.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\n[Aside.] O, 'tis too true!\r\nHow smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!\r\nThe harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,\r\nIs not more ugly to the thing that helps it\r\nThan is my deed to my most painted word:\r\nO heavy burden!\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nI hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt King and Polonius.]\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nTo be, or not to be,--that is the question:--\r\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\r\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\r\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\r\nAnd by opposing end them?--To die,--to sleep,--\r\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\r\nThe heartache, and the thousand natural shocks\r\nThat flesh is heir to,--'tis a consummation\r\nDevoutly to be wish'd. To die,--to sleep;--\r\nTo sleep! perchance to dream:--ay, there's the rub;\r\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\r\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\r\nMust give us pause: there's the respect\r\nThat makes calamity of so long life;\r\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\r\nThe oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\r\nThe pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,\r\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\r\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\r\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\r\nWith a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear,\r\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\r\nBut that the dread of something after death,--\r\nThe undiscover'd country, from whose bourn\r\nNo traveller returns,--puzzles the will,\r\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\r\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\r\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all;\r\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\r\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;\r\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment,\r\nWith this regard, their currents turn awry,\r\nAnd lose the name of action.--Soft you now!\r\nThe fair Ophelia!--Nymph, in thy orisons\r\nBe all my sins remember'd.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nGood my lord,\r\nHow does your honour for this many a day?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI humbly thank you; well, well, well.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nMy lord, I have remembrances of yours\r\nThat I have longed long to re-deliver.\r\nI pray you, now receive them.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNo, not I;\r\nI never gave you aught.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nMy honour'd lord, you know right well you did;\r\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath compos'd\r\nAs made the things more rich; their perfume lost,\r\nTake these again; for to the noble mind\r\nRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\r\nThere, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHa, ha! are you honest?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nMy lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAre you fair?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nWhat means your lordship?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThat if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no\r\ndiscourse to your beauty.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nCould beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform\r\nhonesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can\r\ntranslate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox,\r\nbut now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nIndeed, my lord, you made me believe so.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nYou should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so\r\ninoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nI was the more deceived.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nGet thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of\r\nsinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse\r\nme of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me:\r\nI am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my\r\nbeck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give\r\nthem shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I\r\ndo crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all;\r\nbelieve none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your\r\nfather?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nAt home, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nLet the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool\r\nnowhere but in's own house. Farewell.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nO, help him, you sweet heavens!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIf thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry,--\r\nbe thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape\r\ncalumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt\r\nneeds marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what\r\nmonsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nO heavenly powers, restore him!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God hath\r\ngiven you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you\r\namble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your\r\nwantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made\r\nme mad. I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are\r\nmarried already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as\r\nthey are. To a nunnery, go.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nO, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!\r\nThe courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,\r\nThe expectancy and rose of the fair state,\r\nThe glass of fashion and the mould of form,\r\nThe observ'd of all observers,--quite, quite down!\r\nAnd I, of ladies most deject and wretched\r\nThat suck'd the honey of his music vows,\r\nNow see that noble and most sovereign reason,\r\nLike sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;\r\nThat unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth\r\nBlasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,\r\nTo have seen what I have seen, see what I see!\r\n\r\n[Re-enter King and Polonius.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nLove! his affections do not that way tend;\r\nNor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,\r\nWas not like madness. There's something in his soul\r\nO'er which his melancholy sits on brood;\r\nAnd I do doubt the hatch and the disclose\r\nWill be some danger: which for to prevent,\r\nI have in quick determination\r\nThus set it down:--he shall with speed to England\r\nFor the demand of our neglected tribute:\r\nHaply the seas, and countries different,\r\nWith variable objects, shall expel\r\nThis something-settled matter in his heart;\r\nWhereon his brains still beating puts him thus\r\nFrom fashion of himself. What think you on't?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nIt shall do well: but yet do I believe\r\nThe origin and commencement of his grief\r\nSprung from neglected love.--How now, Ophelia!\r\nYou need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;\r\nWe heard it all.--My lord, do as you please;\r\nBut if you hold it fit, after the play,\r\nLet his queen mother all alone entreat him\r\nTo show his grief: let her be round with him;\r\nAnd I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear\r\nOf all their conference. If she find him not,\r\nTo England send him; or confine him where\r\nYour wisdom best shall think.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nIt shall be so:\r\nMadness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II. A hall in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet and certain Players.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSpeak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,\r\ntrippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your\r\nplayers do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do\r\nnot saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all\r\ngently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,\r\nwhirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a\r\ntemperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the\r\nsoul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to\r\ntatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who,\r\nfor the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb\r\nshows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing\r\nTermagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.\r\n\r\nI Player.\r\nI warrant your honour.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nBe not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your\r\ntutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with\r\nthis special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of\r\nnature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,\r\nwhose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as\r\n'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image,\r\nscorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his\r\nform and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though\r\nit make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious\r\ngrieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance,\r\no'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I\r\nhave seen play,--and heard others praise, and that highly,--not\r\nto speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of\r\nChristians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so\r\nstrutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's\r\njourneymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated\r\nhumanity so abominably.\r\n\r\nI Player.\r\nI hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns\r\nspeak no more than is set down for them: for there be of them\r\nthat will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren\r\nspectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary\r\nquestion of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous\r\nand shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go\r\nmake you ready.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Players.]\r\n\r\n[Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nHow now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nAnd the queen too, and that presently.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nBid the players make haste.\r\n\r\n[Exit Polonius.]\r\n\r\nWill you two help to hasten them?\r\n\r\nRos. and Guil.\r\nWe will, my lord.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat, ho, Horatio!\r\n\r\n[Enter Horatio.]\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nHere, sweet lord, at your service.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHoratio, thou art e'en as just a man\r\nAs e'er my conversation cop'd withal.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nO, my dear lord,--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNay, do not think I flatter;\r\nFor what advancement may I hope from thee,\r\nThat no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,\r\nTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?\r\nNo, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;\r\nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\r\nWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?\r\nSince my dear soul was mistress of her choice,\r\nAnd could of men distinguish, her election\r\nHath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been\r\nAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;\r\nA man that Fortune's buffets and rewards\r\nHast ta'en with equal thanks: and bles'd are those\r\nWhose blood and judgment are so well commingled\r\nThat they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger\r\nTo sound what stop she please. Give me that man\r\nThat is not passion's slave, and I will wear him\r\nIn my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,\r\nAs I do thee.--Something too much of this.--\r\nThere is a play to-night before the king;\r\nOne scene of it comes near the circumstance,\r\nWhich I have told thee, of my father's death:\r\nI pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,\r\nEven with the very comment of thy soul\r\nObserve mine uncle: if his occulted guilt\r\nDo not itself unkennel in one speech,\r\nIt is a damned ghost that we have seen;\r\nAnd my imaginations are as foul\r\nAs Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;\r\nFor I mine eyes will rivet to his face;\r\nAnd, after, we will both our judgments join\r\nIn censure of his seeming.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWell, my lord:\r\nIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,\r\nAnd scape detecting, I will pay the theft.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThey are coming to the play. I must be idle:\r\nGet you a place.\r\n\r\n[Danish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia,\r\nRosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nHow fares our cousin Hamlet?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nExcellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air,\r\npromise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nI have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNo, nor mine now. My lord, you play'd once i' the university, you\r\nsay? [To Polonius.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nThat did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat did you enact?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nI did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' the Capitol; Brutus\r\nkilled me.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIt was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.--Be\r\nthe players ready?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nAy, my lord; they stay upon your patience.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nCome hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNo, good mother, here's metal more attractive.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nO, ho! do you mark that? [To the King.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nLady, shall I lie in your lap?\r\n[Lying down at Ophelia's feet.]\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nNo, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI mean, my head upon your lap?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nAy, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDo you think I meant country matters?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nI think nothing, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThat's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nWhat is, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nYou are merry, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWho, I?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nAy, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?\r\nfor look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died\r\nwithin 's two hours.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nNay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSo long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a\r\nsuit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten\r\nyet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life\r\nhalf a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches then; or else\r\nshall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose\r\nepitaph is 'For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'\r\n\r\n[Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters.]\r\n\r\n[Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing\r\nhim and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation\r\nunto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her\r\nneck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing\r\nhim asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his\r\ncrown, kisses it, pours poison in the king's ears, and exit. The\r\nQueen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action.\r\nThe Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,\r\nseeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The\r\nPoisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she seems loth and unwilling\r\nawhile, but in the end accepts his love.]\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nWhat means this, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMarry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nBelike this show imports the argument of the play.\r\n\r\n[Enter Prologue.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWe shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel;\r\nthey'll tell all.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nWill he tell us what this show meant?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, or any show that you'll show him: be not you ashamed to\r\nshow, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nYou are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.\r\n\r\nPro.\r\n   For us, and for our tragedy,\r\n   Here stooping to your clemency,\r\n   We beg your hearing patiently.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIs this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\n'Tis brief, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAs woman's love.\r\n\r\n[Enter a King and a Queen.]\r\n\r\nP. King.\r\nFull thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round\r\nNeptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,\r\nAnd thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen\r\nAbout the world have times twelve thirties been,\r\nSince love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,\r\nUnite commutual in most sacred bands.\r\n\r\nP. Queen.\r\nSo many journeys may the sun and moon\r\nMake us again count o'er ere love be done!\r\nBut, woe is me, you are so sick of late,\r\nSo far from cheer and from your former state.\r\nThat I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,\r\nDiscomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:\r\nFor women's fear and love holds quantity;\r\nIn neither aught, or in extremity.\r\nNow, what my love is, proof hath made you know;\r\nAnd as my love is siz'd, my fear is so:\r\nWhere love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;\r\nWhere little fears grow great, great love grows there.\r\n\r\nP. King.\r\nFaith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;\r\nMy operant powers their functions leave to do:\r\nAnd thou shalt live in this fair world behind,\r\nHonour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind\r\nFor husband shalt thou,--\r\n\r\nP. Queen.\r\nO, confound the rest!\r\nSuch love must needs be treason in my breast:\r\nIn second husband let me be accurst!\r\nNone wed the second but who kill'd the first.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n[Aside.] Wormwood, wormwood!\r\n\r\nP. Queen.\r\nThe instances that second marriage move\r\nAre base respects of thrift, but none of love.\r\nA second time I kill my husband dead\r\nWhen second husband kisses me in bed.\r\n\r\nP. King.\r\nI do believe you think what now you speak;\r\nBut what we do determine oft we break.\r\nPurpose is but the slave to memory;\r\nOf violent birth, but poor validity:\r\nWhich now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;\r\nBut fall unshaken when they mellow be.\r\nMost necessary 'tis that we forget\r\nTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:\r\nWhat to ourselves in passion we propose,\r\nThe passion ending, doth the purpose lose.\r\nThe violence of either grief or joy\r\nTheir own enactures with themselves destroy:\r\nWhere joy most revels, grief doth most lament;\r\nGrief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.\r\nThis world is not for aye; nor 'tis not strange\r\nThat even our loves should with our fortunes change;\r\nFor 'tis a question left us yet to prove,\r\nWhether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.\r\nThe great man down, you mark his favourite flies,\r\nThe poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;\r\nAnd hitherto doth love on fortune tend:\r\nFor who not needs shall never lack a friend;\r\nAnd who in want a hollow friend doth try,\r\nDirectly seasons him his enemy.\r\nBut, orderly to end where I begun,--\r\nOur wills and fates do so contrary run\r\nThat our devices still are overthrown;\r\nOur thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:\r\nSo think thou wilt no second husband wed;\r\nBut die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.\r\n\r\nP. Queen.\r\nNor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!\r\nSport and repose lock from me day and night!\r\nTo desperation turn my trust and hope!\r\nAn anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!\r\nEach opposite that blanks the face of joy\r\nMeet what I would have well, and it destroy!\r\nBoth here and hence pursue me lasting strife,\r\nIf, once a widow, ever I be wife!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIf she should break it now! [To Ophelia.]\r\n\r\nP. King.\r\n'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;\r\nMy spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile\r\nThe tedious day with sleep.\r\n[Sleeps.]\r\n\r\nP. Queen.\r\nSleep rock thy brain,\r\nAnd never come mischance between us twain!\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMadam, how like you this play?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nThe lady protests too much, methinks.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO, but she'll keep her word.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nHave you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNo, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWhat do you call the play?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThe Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the\r\nimage of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name;\r\nhis wife, Baptista: you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of\r\nwork: but what o' that? your majesty, and we that have free\r\nsouls, it touches us not: let the gall'd jade wince; our withers\r\nare unwrung.\r\n\r\n[Enter Lucianus.]\r\n\r\nThis is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nYou are a good chorus, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI could interpret between you and your love, if I could see\r\nthe puppets dallying.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nYou are keen, my lord, you are keen.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIt would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nStill better, and worse.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSo you must take your husbands.--Begin, murderer; pox, leave\r\nthy damnable faces, and begin. Come:--'The croaking raven doth\r\nbellow for revenge.'\r\n\r\nLuc.\r\nThoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;\r\nConfederate season, else no creature seeing;\r\nThou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,\r\nWith Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,\r\nThy natural magic and dire property\r\nOn wholesome life usurp immediately.\r\n\r\n[Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHe poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago:\r\nThe story is extant, and written in very choice Italian; you\r\nshall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nThe King rises.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat, frighted with false fire!\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nHow fares my lord?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nGive o'er the play.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nGive me some light:--away!\r\n\r\nAll.\r\nLights, lights, lights!\r\n\r\n[Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,\r\n     The hart ungalled play;\r\n   For some must watch, while some must sleep:\r\n     So runs the world away.--\r\nWould not this, sir, and a forest of feathers--if the rest of my\r\nfortunes turn Turk with me,--with two Provincial roses on my\r\nrazed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nHalf a share.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n     A whole one, I.\r\n   For thou dost know, O Damon dear,\r\n     This realm dismantled was\r\n   Of Jove himself; and now reigns here\r\n     A very, very--pajock.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nYou might have rhymed.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand\r\npound! Didst perceive?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nVery well, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nUpon the talk of the poisoning?--\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nI did very well note him.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAh, ha!--Come, some music! Come, the recorders!--\r\n   For if the king like not the comedy,\r\n   Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.\r\nCome, some music!\r\n\r\n[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nGood my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSir, a whole history.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nThe king, sir--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, sir, what of him?\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nIs, in his retirement, marvellous distempered.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWith drink, sir?\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nNo, my lord; rather with choler.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nYour wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to\r\nthe doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps\r\nplunge him into far more choler.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nGood my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start\r\nnot so wildly from my affair.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI am tame, sir:--pronounce.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nThe queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit,\r\nhath sent me to you.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nYou are welcome.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nNay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.\r\nIf it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do\r\nyour mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return\r\nshall be the end of my business.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSir, I cannot.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nWhat, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMake you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such\r\nanswer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,\r\nmy mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you\r\nsay,--\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nThen thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into\r\namazement and admiration.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother!--But is there no\r\nsequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nShe desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWe shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any\r\nfurther trade with us?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nMy lord, you once did love me.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAnd so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nGood my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely,\r\nbar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to\r\nyour friend.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSir, I lack advancement.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nHow can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself\r\nfor your succession in Denmark?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, sir, but 'While the grass grows'--the proverb is something\r\nmusty.\r\n\r\n[Re-enter the Players, with recorders.]\r\n\r\nO, the recorders:--let me see one.--To withdraw with you:--why do\r\nyou go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me\r\ninto a toil?\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nO my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nMy lord, I cannot.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI pray you.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nBelieve me, I cannot.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI do beseech you.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nI know, no touch of it, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your\r\nfinger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will\r\ndiscourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nBut these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I\r\nhave not the skill.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You\r\nwould play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would\r\npluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my\r\nlowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,\r\nexcellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it\r\nspeak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a\r\npipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,\r\nyou cannot play upon me.\r\n\r\n[Enter Polonius.]\r\n\r\nGod bless you, sir!\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nMy lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDo you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nBy the mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMethinks it is like a weasel.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nIt is backed like a weasel.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nOr like a whale.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nVery like a whale.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThen will I come to my mother by and by.--They fool me to the\r\ntop of my bent.--I will come by and by.\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nI will say so.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nBy-and-by is easily said.\r\n\r\n[Exit Polonius.]\r\n\r\n--Leave me, friends.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Ros, Guil., Hor., and Players.]\r\n\r\n'Tis now the very witching time of night,\r\nWhen churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out\r\nContagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,\r\nAnd do such bitter business as the day\r\nWould quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.--\r\nO heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever\r\nThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:\r\nLet me be cruel, not unnatural;\r\nI will speak daggers to her, but use none;\r\nMy tongue and soul in this be hypocrites,--\r\nHow in my words somever she be shent,\r\nTo give them seals never, my soul, consent!\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III. A room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nI like him not; nor stands it safe with us\r\nTo let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;\r\nI your commission will forthwith dispatch,\r\nAnd he to England shall along with you:\r\nThe terms of our estate may not endure\r\nHazard so near us as doth hourly grow\r\nOut of his lunacies.\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nWe will ourselves provide:\r\nMost holy and religious fear it is\r\nTo keep those many many bodies safe\r\nThat live and feed upon your majesty.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nThe single and peculiar life is bound,\r\nWith all the strength and armour of the mind,\r\nTo keep itself from 'noyance; but much more\r\nThat spirit upon whose weal depend and rest\r\nThe lives of many. The cease of majesty\r\nDies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw\r\nWhat's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,\r\nFix'd on the summit of the highest mount,\r\nTo whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things\r\nAre mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,\r\nEach small annexment, petty consequence,\r\nAttends the boisterous ruin. Never alone\r\nDid the king sigh, but with a general groan.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nArm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;\r\nFor we will fetters put upon this fear,\r\nWhich now goes too free-footed.\r\n\r\nRos and Guil.\r\nWe will haste us.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]\r\n\r\n[Enter Polonius.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nMy lord, he's going to his mother's closet:\r\nBehind the arras I'll convey myself\r\nTo hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home:\r\nAnd, as you said, and wisely was it said,\r\n'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,\r\nSince nature makes them partial, should o'erhear\r\nThe speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:\r\nI'll call upon you ere you go to bed,\r\nAnd tell you what I know.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nThanks, dear my lord.\r\n\r\n[Exit Polonius.]\r\n\r\nO, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;\r\nIt hath the primal eldest curse upon't,--\r\nA brother's murder!--Pray can I not,\r\nThough inclination be as sharp as will:\r\nMy stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;\r\nAnd, like a man to double business bound,\r\nI stand in pause where I shall first begin,\r\nAnd both neglect. What if this cursed hand\r\nWere thicker than itself with brother's blood,--\r\nIs there not rain enough in the sweet heavens\r\nTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy\r\nBut to confront the visage of offence?\r\nAnd what's in prayer but this twofold force,--\r\nTo be forestalled ere we come to fall,\r\nOr pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;\r\nMy fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer\r\nCan serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!--\r\nThat cannot be; since I am still possess'd\r\nOf those effects for which I did the murder,--\r\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.\r\nMay one be pardon'd and retain the offence?\r\nIn the corrupted currents of this world\r\nOffence's gilded hand may shove by justice;\r\nAnd oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself\r\nBuys out the law; but 'tis not so above;\r\nThere is no shuffling;--there the action lies\r\nIn his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,\r\nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\r\nTo give in evidence. What then? what rests?\r\nTry what repentance can: what can it not?\r\nYet what can it when one cannot repent?\r\nO wretched state! O bosom black as death!\r\nO limed soul, that, struggling to be free,\r\nArt more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay:\r\nBow, stubborn knees; and, heart, with strings of steel,\r\nBe soft as sinews of the new-born babe!\r\nAll may be well.\r\n\r\n[Retires and kneels.]\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNow might I do it pat, now he is praying;\r\nAnd now I'll do't;--and so he goes to heaven;\r\nAnd so am I reveng'd.--that would be scann'd:\r\nA villain kills my father; and for that,\r\nI, his sole son, do this same villain send\r\nTo heaven.\r\nO, this is hire and salary, not revenge.\r\nHe took my father grossly, full of bread;\r\nWith all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;\r\nAnd how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?\r\nBut in our circumstance and course of thought,\r\n'Tis heavy with him: and am I, then, reveng'd,\r\nTo take him in the purging of his soul,\r\nWhen he is fit and season'd for his passage?\r\nNo.\r\nUp, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:\r\nWhen he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;\r\nOr in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;\r\nAt gaming, swearing; or about some act\r\nThat has no relish of salvation in't;--\r\nThen trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven;\r\nAnd that his soul may be as damn'd and black\r\nAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:\r\nThis physic but prolongs thy sickly days.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n[The King rises and advances.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nMy words fly up, my thoughts remain below:\r\nWords without thoughts never to heaven go.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV. Another room in the castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter Queen and Polonius.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\nHe will come straight. Look you lay home to him:\r\nTell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,\r\nAnd that your grace hath screen'd and stood between\r\nMuch heat and him. I'll silence me e'en here.\r\nPray you, be round with him.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n[Within.] Mother, mother, mother!\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nI'll warrant you:\r\nFear me not:--withdraw; I hear him coming.\r\n\r\n[Polonius goes behind the arras.]\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNow, mother, what's the matter?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nHamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMother, you have my father much offended.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nCome, come, you answer with an idle tongue.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nGo, go, you question with a wicked tongue.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nWhy, how now, Hamlet!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat's the matter now?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nHave you forgot me?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNo, by the rood, not so:\r\nYou are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,\r\nAnd,--would it were not so!--you are my mother.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nNay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nCome, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;\r\nYou go not till I set you up a glass\r\nWhere you may see the inmost part of you.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nWhat wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?--\r\nHelp, help, ho!\r\n\r\nPol.\r\n[Behind.] What, ho! help, help, help!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow now? a rat? [Draws.]\r\nDead for a ducat, dead!\r\n\r\n[Makes a pass through the arras.]\r\n\r\nPol.\r\n[Behind.] O, I am slain!\r\n\r\n[Falls and dies.]\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nO me, what hast thou done?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNay, I know not: is it the king?\r\n\r\n[Draws forth Polonius.]\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nO, what a rash and bloody deed is this!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nA bloody deed!--almost as bad, good mother,\r\nAs kill a king and marry with his brother.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nAs kill a king!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, lady, 'twas my word.--\r\nThou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!\r\n[To Polonius.]\r\nI took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;\r\nThou find'st to be too busy is some danger.--\r\nLeave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,\r\nAnd let me wring your heart: for so I shall,\r\nIf it be made of penetrable stuff;\r\nIf damned custom have not braz'd it so\r\nThat it is proof and bulwark against sense.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nWhat have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue\r\nIn noise so rude against me?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSuch an act\r\nThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty;\r\nCalls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose\r\nFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love,\r\nAnd sets a blister there; makes marriage-vows\r\nAs false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed\r\nAs from the body of contraction plucks\r\nThe very soul, and sweet religion makes\r\nA rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;\r\nYea, this solidity and compound mass,\r\nWith tristful visage, as against the doom,\r\nIs thought-sick at the act.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nAh me, what act,\r\nThat roars so loud, and thunders in the index?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nLook here upon this picture, and on this,--\r\nThe counterfeit presentment of two brothers.\r\nSee what a grace was seated on this brow;\r\nHyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;\r\nAn eye like Mars, to threaten and command;\r\nA station like the herald Mercury\r\nNew lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:\r\nA combination and a form, indeed,\r\nWhere every god did seem to set his seal,\r\nTo give the world assurance of a man;\r\nThis was your husband.--Look you now what follows:\r\nHere is your husband, like a milldew'd ear\r\nBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?\r\nCould you on this fair mountain leave to feed,\r\nAnd batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?\r\nYou cannot call it love; for at your age\r\nThe hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,\r\nAnd waits upon the judgment: and what judgment\r\nWould step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,\r\nElse could you not have motion: but sure that sense\r\nIs apoplex'd; for madness would not err;\r\nNor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd\r\nBut it reserv'd some quantity of choice\r\nTo serve in such a difference. What devil was't\r\nThat thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?\r\nEyes without feeling, feeling without sight,\r\nEars without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,\r\nOr but a sickly part of one true sense\r\nCould not so mope.\r\nO shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,\r\nIf thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,\r\nTo flaming youth let virtue be as wax,\r\nAnd melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame\r\nWhen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,\r\nSince frost itself as actively doth burn,\r\nAnd reason panders will.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nO Hamlet, speak no more:\r\nThou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;\r\nAnd there I see such black and grained spots\r\nAs will not leave their tinct.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNay, but to live\r\nIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\r\nStew'd in corruption, honeying and making love\r\nOver the nasty sty,--\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nO, speak to me no more;\r\nThese words like daggers enter in mine ears;\r\nNo more, sweet Hamlet.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nA murderer and a villain;\r\nA slave that is not twentieth part the tithe\r\nOf your precedent lord; a vice of kings;\r\nA cutpurse of the empire and the rule,\r\nThat from a shelf the precious diadem stole\r\nAnd put it in his pocket!\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nNo more.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nA king of shreds and patches!--\r\n\r\n[Enter Ghost.]\r\n\r\nSave me and hover o'er me with your wings,\r\nYou heavenly guards!--What would your gracious figure?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nAlas, he's mad!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDo you not come your tardy son to chide,\r\nThat, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by\r\nThe important acting of your dread command?\r\nO, say!\r\n\r\nGhost.\r\nDo not forget. This visitation\r\nIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\r\nBut, look, amazement on thy mother sits:\r\nO, step between her and her fighting soul,--\r\nConceit in weakest bodies strongest works,--\r\nSpeak to her, Hamlet.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow is it with you, lady?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nAlas, how is't with you,\r\nThat you do bend your eye on vacancy,\r\nAnd with the incorporal air do hold discourse?\r\nForth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;\r\nAnd, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,\r\nYour bedded hairs, like life in excrements,\r\nStart up and stand an end. O gentle son,\r\nUpon the heat and flame of thy distemper\r\nSprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nOn him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!\r\nHis form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,\r\nWould make them capable.--Do not look upon me;\r\nLest with this piteous action you convert\r\nMy stern effects: then what I have to do\r\nWill want true colour; tears perchance for blood.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nTo whom do you speak this?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDo you see nothing there?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nNothing at all; yet all that is I see.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNor did you nothing hear?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nNo, nothing but ourselves.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, look you there! look how it steals away!\r\nMy father, in his habit as he liv'd!\r\nLook, where he goes, even now out at the portal!\r\n\r\n[Exit Ghost.]\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nThis is the very coinage of your brain:\r\nThis bodiless creation ecstasy\r\nIs very cunning in.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nEcstasy!\r\nMy pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,\r\nAnd makes as healthful music: it is not madness\r\nThat I have utter'd: bring me to the test,\r\nAnd I the matter will re-word; which madness\r\nWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,\r\nLay not that flattering unction to your soul\r\nThat not your trespass, but my madness speaks:\r\nIt will but skin and film the ulcerous place,\r\nWhilst rank corruption, mining all within,\r\nInfects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;\r\nRepent what's past; avoid what is to come;\r\nAnd do not spread the compost on the weeds,\r\nTo make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;\r\nFor in the fatness of these pursy times\r\nVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,\r\nYea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO, throw away the worser part of it,\r\nAnd live the purer with the other half.\r\nGood night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;\r\nAssume a virtue, if you have it not.\r\nThat monster custom, who all sense doth eat,\r\nOf habits evil, is angel yet in this,--\r\nThat to the use of actions fair and good\r\nHe likewise gives a frock or livery\r\nThat aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;\r\nAnd that shall lend a kind of easiness\r\nTo the next abstinence: the next more easy;\r\nFor use almost can change the stamp of nature,\r\nAnd either curb the devil, or throw him out\r\nWith wondrous potency. Once more, good-night:\r\nAnd when you are desirous to be bles'd,\r\nI'll blessing beg of you.--For this same lord\r\n[Pointing to Polonius.]\r\nI do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,\r\nTo punish me with this, and this with me,\r\nThat I must be their scourge and minister.\r\nI will bestow him, and will answer well\r\nThe death I gave him. So again, good-night.--\r\nI must be cruel, only to be kind:\r\nThus bad begins, and worse remains behind.--\r\nOne word more, good lady.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nWhat shall I do?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNot this, by no means, that I bid you do:\r\nLet the bloat king tempt you again to bed;\r\nPinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;\r\nAnd let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,\r\nOr paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,\r\nMake you to ravel all this matter out,\r\nThat I essentially am not in madness,\r\nBut mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;\r\nFor who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,\r\nWould from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\r\nSuch dear concernings hide? who would do so?\r\nNo, in despite of sense and secrecy,\r\nUnpeg the basket on the house's top,\r\nLet the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,\r\nTo try conclusions, in the basket creep\r\nAnd break your own neck down.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nBe thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,\r\nAnd breath of life, I have no life to breathe\r\nWhat thou hast said to me.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI must to England; you know that?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nAlack,\r\nI had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThere's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,--\r\nWhom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,--\r\nThey bear the mandate; they must sweep my way\r\nAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work;\r\nFor 'tis the sport to have the enginer\r\nHoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard\r\nBut I will delve one yard below their mines\r\nAnd blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,\r\nWhen in one line two crafts directly meet.--\r\nThis man shall set me packing:\r\nI'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.--\r\nMother, good-night.--Indeed, this counsellor\r\nIs now most still, most secret, and most grave,\r\nWho was in life a foolish peating knave.\r\nCome, sir, to draw toward an end with you:--\r\nGood night, mother.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt severally; Hamlet, dragging out Polonius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT IV.\r\n\r\nScene I. A room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nThere's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves\r\nYou must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.\r\nWhere is your son?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nBestow this place on us a little while.\r\n\r\n[To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who go out.]\r\n\r\nAh, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWhat, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nMad as the sea and wind, when both contend\r\nWhich is the mightier: in his lawless fit\r\nBehind the arras hearing something stir,\r\nWhips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'\r\nAnd in this brainish apprehension, kills\r\nThe unseen good old man.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nO heavy deed!\r\nIt had been so with us, had we been there:\r\nHis liberty is full of threats to all;\r\nTo you yourself, to us, to every one.\r\nAlas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?\r\nIt will be laid to us, whose providence\r\nShould have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt\r\nThis mad young man. But so much was our love\r\nWe would not understand what was most fit;\r\nBut, like the owner of a foul disease,\r\nTo keep it from divulging, let it feed\r\nEven on the pith of life. Where is he gone?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nTo draw apart the body he hath kill'd:\r\nO'er whom his very madness, like some ore\r\nAmong a mineral of metals base,\r\nShows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nO Gertrude, come away!\r\nThe sun no sooner shall the mountains touch\r\nBut we will ship him hence: and this vile deed\r\nWe must with all our majesty and skill\r\nBoth countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern!\r\n\r\n[Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nFriends both, go join you with some further aid:\r\nHamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,\r\nAnd from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:\r\nGo seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body\r\nInto the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nCome, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;\r\nAnd let them know both what we mean to do\r\nAnd what's untimely done: so haply slander,--\r\nWhose whisper o'er the world's diameter,\r\nAs level as the cannon to his blank,\r\nTransports his poison'd shot,--may miss our name,\r\nAnd hit the woundless air.--O, come away!\r\nMy soul is full of discord and dismay.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nScene II. Another room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSafely stowed.\r\n\r\nRos. and Guil.\r\n[Within.] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.\r\n\r\n[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nWhat have you done, my lord, with the dead body?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nCompounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nTell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence,\r\nAnd bear it to the chapel.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDo not believe it.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nBelieve what?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThat I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be\r\ndemanded of a sponge!--what replication should be made by the son\r\nof a king?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nTake you me for a sponge, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,\r\nhis authorities. But such officers do the king best service in\r\nthe end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;\r\nfirst mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have\r\ngleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nI understand you not, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nMy lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThe body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.\r\nThe king is a thing,--\r\n\r\nGuil.\r\nA thing, my lord!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nOf nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III. Another room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter King,attended.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nI have sent to seek him and to find the body.\r\nHow dangerous is it that this man goes loose!\r\nYet must not we put the strong law on him:\r\nHe's lov'd of the distracted multitude,\r\nWho like not in their judgment, but their eyes;\r\nAnd where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,\r\nBut never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,\r\nThis sudden sending him away must seem\r\nDeliberate pause: diseases desperate grown\r\nBy desperate appliance are reliev'd,\r\nOr not at all.\r\n\r\n[Enter Rosencrantz.]\r\n\r\nHow now! what hath befall'n?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nWhere the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,\r\nWe cannot get from him.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nBut where is he?\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nWithout, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nBring him before us.\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nHo, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nNow, Hamlet, where's Polonius?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAt supper.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nAt supper! where?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNot where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain\r\nconvocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your\r\nonly emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and\r\nwe fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar\r\nis but variable service,--two dishes, but to one table: that's\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nAlas, alas!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nA man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat\r\nof the fish that hath fed of that worm.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWhat dost thou mean by this?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through\r\nthe guts of a beggar.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWhere is Polonius?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIn heaven: send thither to see: if your messenger find him not\r\nthere, seek him i' the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you\r\nfind him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up\r\nthe stairs into the lobby.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nGo seek him there. [To some Attendants.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHe will stay till you come.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Attendants.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nHamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--\r\nWhich we do tender, as we dearly grieve\r\nFor that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence\r\nWith fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;\r\nThe bark is ready, and the wind at help,\r\nThe associates tend, and everything is bent\r\nFor England.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nFor England!\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nAy, Hamlet.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nGood.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nSo is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI see a cherub that sees them.--But, come; for England!--\r\nFarewell, dear mother.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nThy loving father, Hamlet.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMy mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is\r\none flesh; and so, my mother.--Come, for England!\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nFollow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;\r\nDelay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:\r\nAway! for everything is seal'd and done\r\nThat else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\r\n\r\nAnd, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,--\r\nAs my great power thereof may give thee sense,\r\nSince yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red\r\nAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awe\r\nPays homage to us,--thou mayst not coldly set\r\nOur sovereign process; which imports at full,\r\nBy letters conjuring to that effect,\r\nThe present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;\r\nFor like the hectic in my blood he rages,\r\nAnd thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,\r\nHowe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV. A plain in Denmark.\r\n\r\n[Enter Fortinbras, and Forces marching.]\r\n\r\nFor.\r\nGo, Captain, from me greet the Danish king:\r\nTell him that, by his license, Fortinbras\r\nCraves the conveyance of a promis'd march\r\nOver his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.\r\nIf that his majesty would aught with us,\r\nWe shall express our duty in his eye;\r\nAnd let him know so.\r\n\r\nCapt.\r\nI will do't, my lord.\r\n\r\nFor.\r\nGo softly on.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt all For. and Forces.]\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, &c.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nGood sir, whose powers are these?\r\n\r\nCapt.\r\nThey are of Norway, sir.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow purpos'd, sir, I pray you?\r\n\r\nCapt.\r\nAgainst some part of Poland.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWho commands them, sir?\r\n\r\nCapt.\r\nThe nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nGoes it against the main of Poland, sir,\r\nOr for some frontier?\r\n\r\nCapt.\r\nTruly to speak, and with no addition,\r\nWe go to gain a little patch of ground\r\nThat hath in it no profit but the name.\r\nTo pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;\r\nNor will it yield to Norway or the Pole\r\nA ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, then the Polack never will defend it.\r\n\r\nCapt.\r\nYes, it is already garrison'd.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nTwo thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats\r\nWill not debate the question of this straw:\r\nThis is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,\r\nThat inward breaks, and shows no cause without\r\nWhy the man dies.--I humbly thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nCapt.\r\nGod b' wi' you, sir.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nRos.\r\nWill't please you go, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI'll be with you straight. Go a little before.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]\r\n\r\nHow all occasions do inform against me\r\nAnd spur my dull revenge! What is a man,\r\nIf his chief good and market of his time\r\nBe but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.\r\nSure he that made us with such large discourse,\r\nLooking before and after, gave us not\r\nThat capability and godlike reason\r\nTo fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be\r\nBestial oblivion, or some craven scruple\r\nOf thinking too precisely on the event,--\r\nA thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom\r\nAnd ever three parts coward,--I do not know\r\nWhy yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'\r\nSith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means\r\nTo do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:\r\nWitness this army, of such mass and charge,\r\nLed by a delicate and tender prince;\r\nWhose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,\r\nMakes mouths at the invisible event;\r\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\r\nTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\r\nEven for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great\r\nIs not to stir without great argument,\r\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\r\nWhen honour's at the stake. How stand I, then,\r\nThat have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,\r\nExcitements of my reason and my blood,\r\nAnd let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see\r\nThe imminent death of twenty thousand men\r\nThat, for a fantasy and trick of fame,\r\nGo to their graves like beds; fight for a plot\r\nWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\r\nWhich is not tomb enough and continent\r\nTo hide the slain?--O, from this time forth,\r\nMy thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene V.

They say the owl was a baker's daughter.\r\nLord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at\r\nyour table!\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nConceit upon her father.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nPray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what\r\nit means, say you this:\r\n[Sings.]\r\n   To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day\r\n     All in the morning bedtime,\r\n   And I a maid at your window,\r\n     To be your Valentine.\r\n\r\n   Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes,\r\n     And dupp'd the chamber door,\r\n   Let in the maid, that out a maid\r\n     Never departed more.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nPretty Ophelia!\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nIndeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:\r\n[Sings.]\r\n   By Gis and by Saint Charity,\r\n     Alack, and fie for shame!\r\n   Young men will do't if they come to't;\r\n     By cock, they are to blame.\r\n\r\n   Quoth she, before you tumbled me,\r\n     You promis'd me to wed.\r\n   So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,\r\n     An thou hadst not come to my bed.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nHow long hath she been thus?\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nI hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot\r\nchoose but weep, to think they would lay him i' the cold ground.\r\nMy brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good\r\ncounsel.--Come, my coach!--Good night, ladies; good night, sweet\r\nladies; good night, good night.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nFollow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.\r\n\r\n[Exit Horatio.]\r\n\r\nO, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs\r\nAll from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,\r\nWhen sorrows come, they come not single spies,\r\nBut in battalions! First, her father slain:\r\nNext, your son gone; and he most violent author\r\nOf his own just remove: the people muddied,\r\nThick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers\r\nFor good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly\r\nIn hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia\r\nDivided from herself and her fair judgment,\r\nWithout the which we are pictures or mere beasts:\r\nLast, and as much containing as all these,\r\nHer brother is in secret come from France;\r\nFeeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,\r\nAnd wants not buzzers to infect his ear\r\nWith pestilent speeches of his father's death;\r\nWherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,\r\nWill nothing stick our person to arraign\r\nIn ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,\r\nLike to a murdering piece, in many places\r\nGive, me superfluous death.\r\n\r\n[A noise within.]\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nAlack, what noise is this?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWhere are my Switzers? let them guard the door.\r\n\r\n[Enter a Gentleman.]\r\n\r\nWhat is the matter?\r\n\r\nGent.\r\nSave yourself, my lord:\r\nThe ocean, overpeering of his list,\r\nEats not the flats with more impetuous haste\r\nThan young Laertes, in a riotous head,\r\nO'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord;\r\nAnd, as the world were now but to begin,\r\nAntiquity forgot, custom not known,\r\nThe ratifiers and props of every word,\r\nThey cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'\r\nCaps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,\r\n'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nHow cheerfully on the false trail they cry!\r\nO, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!\r\n\r\n[A noise within.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nThe doors are broke.\r\n\r\n[Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.]\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nWhere is this king?--Sirs, stand you all without.\r\n\r\nDanes.\r\nNo, let's come in.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nI pray you, give me leave.\r\n\r\nDanes.\r\nWe will, we will.\r\n\r\n[They retire without the door.]\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nI thank you:--keep the door.--O thou vile king,\r\nGive me my father!\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nCalmly, good Laertes.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nThat drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;\r\nCries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot\r\nEven here, between the chaste unsmirched brow\r\nOf my true mother.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWhat is the cause, Laertes,\r\nThat thy rebellion looks so giant-like?--\r\nLet him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:\r\nThere's such divinity doth hedge a king,\r\nThat treason can but peep to what it would,\r\nActs little of his will.--Tell me, Laertes,\r\nWhy thou art thus incens'd.--Let him go, Gertrude:--\r\nSpeak, man.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nWhere is my father?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nDead.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nBut not by him.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nLet him demand his fill.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nHow came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:\r\nTo hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!\r\nConscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!\r\nI dare damnation:--to this point I stand,--\r\nThat both the worlds, I give to negligence,\r\nLet come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd\r\nMost throughly for my father.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWho shall stay you?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nMy will, not all the world:\r\nAnd for my means, I'll husband them so well,\r\nThey shall go far with little.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nGood Laertes,\r\nIf you desire to know the certainty\r\nOf your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge\r\nThat, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,\r\nWinner and loser?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nNone but his enemies.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWill you know them then?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nTo his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;\r\nAnd, like the kind life-rendering pelican,\r\nRepast them with my blood.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nWhy, now you speak\r\nLike a good child and a true gentleman.\r\nThat I am guiltless of your father's death,\r\nAnd am most sensibly in grief for it,\r\nIt shall as level to your judgment pierce\r\nAs day does to your eye.\r\n\r\nDanes.\r\n[Within] Let her come in.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nHow now! What noise is that?\r\n\r\n[Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and\r\nflowers.]\r\n\r\nO heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,\r\nBurn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!--\r\nBy heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,\r\nTill our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!\r\nDear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!--\r\nO heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits\r\nShould be as mortal as an old man's life?\r\nNature is fine in love; and where 'tis fine,\r\nIt sends some precious instance of itself\r\nAfter the thing it loves.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\n[Sings.]\r\n   They bore him barefac'd on the bier\r\n   Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny\r\n   And on his grave rain'd many a tear.--\r\n\r\nFare you well, my dove!\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nHadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,\r\nIt could not move thus.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nYou must sing 'Down a-down, an you call him a-down-a.' O,\r\nhow the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his\r\nmaster's daughter.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nThis nothing's more than matter.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nThere's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love,\r\nremember: and there is pansies, that's for thoughts.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nA document in madness,--thoughts and remembrance fitted.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\nThere's fennel for you, and columbines:--there's rue for you;\r\nand here's some for me:--we may call it herb of grace o'\r\nSundays:--O, you must wear your rue with a difference.--There's a\r\ndaisy:--I would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when\r\nmy father died:--they say he made a good end,--\r\n[Sings.]\r\n   For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy,--\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nThought and affliction, passion, hell itself,\r\nShe turns to favour and to prettiness.\r\n\r\nOph.\r\n[Sings.]\r\n   And will he not come again?\r\n   And will he not come again?\r\n     No, no, he is dead,\r\n     Go to thy death-bed,\r\n   He never will come again.\r\n\r\n   His beard was as white as snow,\r\n   All flaxen was his poll:\r\n     He is gone, he is gone,\r\n     And we cast away moan:\r\n   God ha' mercy on his soul!\r\n\r\nAnd of all Christian souls, I pray God.--God b' wi' ye.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nDo you see this, O God?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nLaertes, I must commune with your grief,\r\nOr you deny me right. Go but apart,\r\nMake choice of whom your wisest friends you will,\r\nAnd they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.\r\nIf by direct or by collateral hand\r\nThey find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,\r\nOur crown, our life, and all that we call ours,\r\nTo you in satisfaction; but if not,\r\nBe you content to lend your patience to us,\r\nAnd we shall jointly labour with your soul\r\nTo give it due content.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nLet this be so;\r\nHis means of death, his obscure burial,--\r\nNo trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,\r\nNo noble rite nor formal ostentation,--\r\nCry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,\r\nThat I must call't in question.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nSo you shall;\r\nAnd where the offence is let the great axe fall.\r\nI pray you go with me.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene VI. Another room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter Horatio and a Servant.]\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWhat are they that would speak with me?\r\n\r\nServant.\r\nSailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nLet them come in.\r\n\r\n[Exit Servant.]\r\n\r\nI do not know from what part of the world\r\nI should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.\r\n\r\n[Enter Sailors.]\r\n\r\nI Sailor.\r\nGod bless you, sir.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nLet him bless thee too.\r\n\r\nSailor.\r\nHe shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,\r\nsir,--it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England; if\r\nyour name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\n[Reads.] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked\r\nthis, give these fellows some means to the king: they have\r\nletters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of\r\nvery warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too\r\nslow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I\r\nboarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I\r\nalone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves\r\nof mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for\r\nthem. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou\r\nto me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words\r\nto speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too\r\nlight for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring\r\nthee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course\r\nfor England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.\r\nHe that thou knowest thine,       HAMLET.'\r\n\r\nCome, I will give you way for these your letters;\r\nAnd do't the speedier, that you may direct me\r\nTo him from whom you brought them.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene VII. Another room in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter King and Laertes.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nNow must your conscience my acquittance seal,\r\nAnd you must put me in your heart for friend,\r\nSith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,\r\nThat he which hath your noble father slain\r\nPursu'd my life.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nIt well appears:--but tell me\r\nWhy you proceeded not against these feats,\r\nSo crimeful and so capital in nature,\r\nAs by your safety, wisdom, all things else,\r\nYou mainly were stirr'd up.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nO, for two special reasons;\r\nWhich may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,\r\nBut yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother\r\nLives almost by his looks; and for myself,--\r\nMy virtue or my plague, be it either which,--\r\nShe's so conjunctive to my life and soul,\r\nThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\r\nI could not but by her. The other motive,\r\nWhy to a public count I might not go,\r\nIs the great love the general gender bear him;\r\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\r\nWould, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\r\nConvert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,\r\nToo slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,\r\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\r\nAnd not where I had aim'd them.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nAnd so have I a noble father lost;\r\nA sister driven into desperate terms,--\r\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\r\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\r\nFor her perfections:--but my revenge will come.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nBreak not your sleeps for that:--you must not think\r\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\r\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger,\r\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:\r\nI lov'd your father, and we love ourself;\r\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine,--\r\n\r\n[Enter a Messenger.]\r\n\r\nHow now! What news?\r\n\r\nMess.\r\nLetters, my lord, from Hamlet:\r\nThis to your majesty; this to the queen.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nFrom Hamlet! Who brought them?\r\n\r\nMess.\r\nSailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:\r\nThey were given me by Claudio:--he receiv'd them\r\nOf him that brought them.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nLaertes, you shall hear them.\r\nLeave us.\r\n\r\n[Exit Messenger.]\r\n\r\n[Reads]'High and mighty,--You shall know I am set naked on your\r\nkingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes:\r\nwhen I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the\r\noccasions of my sudden and more strange return.       HAMLET.'\r\n\r\nWhat should this mean? Are all the rest come back?\r\nOr is it some abuse, and no such thing?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nKnow you the hand?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\n'Tis Hamlet's character:--'Naked!'--\r\nAnd in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'\r\nCan you advise me?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nI am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;\r\nIt warms the very sickness in my heart\r\nThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth,\r\n'Thus didest thou.'\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nIf it be so, Laertes,--\r\nAs how should it be so? how otherwise?--\r\nWill you be rul'd by me?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nAy, my lord;\r\nSo you will not o'errule me to a peace.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nTo thine own peace. If he be now return'd--\r\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\r\nNo more to undertake it,--I will work him\r\nTo exploit, now ripe in my device,\r\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall:\r\nAnd for his death no wind shall breathe;\r\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice\r\nAnd call it accident.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nMy lord, I will be rul'd;\r\nThe rather if you could devise it so\r\nThat I might be the organ.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nIt falls right.\r\nYou have been talk'd of since your travel much,\r\nAnd that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality\r\nWherein they say you shine: your sum of parts\r\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\r\nAs did that one; and that, in my regard,\r\nOf the unworthiest siege.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nWhat part is that, my lord?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nA very riband in the cap of youth,\r\nYet needful too; for youth no less becomes\r\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\r\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\r\nImporting health and graveness.--Two months since,\r\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy,--\r\nI've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,\r\nAnd they can well on horseback: but this gallant\r\nHad witchcraft in't: he grew unto his seat;\r\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse,\r\nAs had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd\r\nWith the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought\r\nThat I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,\r\nCome short of what he did.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nA Norman was't?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nA Norman.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nUpon my life, Lamond.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nThe very same.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nI know him well: he is the brooch indeed\r\nAnd gem of all the nation.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nHe made confession of you;\r\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\r\nFor art and exercise in your defence,\r\nAnd for your rapier most especially,\r\nThat he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed\r\nIf one could match you: the scrimers of their nation\r\nHe swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\r\nIf you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his\r\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\r\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\r\nYour sudden coming o'er, to play with him.\r\nNow, out of this,--\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nWhat out of this, my lord?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\r\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\r\nA face without a heart?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nWhy ask you this?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nNot that I think you did not love your father;\r\nBut that I know love is begun by time,\r\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\r\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\r\nThere lives within the very flame of love\r\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\r\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still;\r\nFor goodness, growing to a plurisy,\r\nDies in his own too much: that we would do,\r\nWe should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,\r\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\r\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\r\nAnd then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,\r\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer:--\r\nHamlet comes back: what would you undertake\r\nTo show yourself your father's son in deed\r\nMore than in words?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nTo cut his throat i' the church.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\r\nRevenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,\r\nWill you do this, keep close within your chamber.\r\nHamlet return'd shall know you are come home:\r\nWe'll put on those shall praise your excellence\r\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\r\nThe Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together\r\nAnd wager on your heads: he, being remiss,\r\nMost generous, and free from all contriving,\r\nWill not peruse the foils; so that with ease,\r\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\r\nA sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,\r\nRequite him for your father.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nI will do't:\r\nAnd for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.\r\nI bought an unction of a mountebank,\r\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\r\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\r\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\r\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\r\nThis is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point\r\nWith this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,\r\nIt may be death.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nLet's further think of this;\r\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\r\nMay fit us to our shape: if this should fail,\r\nAnd that our drift look through our bad performance.\r\n'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project\r\nShould have a back or second, that might hold\r\nIf this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see:--\r\nWe'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,--\r\nI ha't:\r\nWhen in your motion you are hot and dry,--\r\nAs make your bouts more violent to that end,--\r\nAnd that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him\r\nA chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,\r\nIf he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,\r\nOur purpose may hold there.\r\n\r\n[Enter Queen.]\r\n\r\nHow now, sweet queen!\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nOne woe doth tread upon another's heel,\r\nSo fast they follow:--your sister's drown'd, Laertes.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nDrown'd! O, where?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nThere is a willow grows aslant a brook,\r\nThat shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;\r\nThere with fantastic garlands did she come\r\nOf crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,\r\nThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\r\nBut our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.\r\nThere, on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds\r\nClamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke;\r\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself\r\nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;\r\nAnd, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;\r\nWhich time she chaunted snatches of old tunes;\r\nAs one incapable of her own distress,\r\nOr like a creature native and indu'd\r\nUnto that element: but long it could not be\r\nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,\r\nPull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay\r\nTo muddy death.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nAlas, then she is drown'd?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nDrown'd, drown'd.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,\r\nAnd therefore I forbid my tears: but yet\r\nIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,\r\nLet shame say what it will: when these are gone,\r\nThe woman will be out.--Adieu, my lord:\r\nI have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,\r\nBut that this folly douts it.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nLet's follow, Gertrude;\r\nHow much I had to do to calm his rage!\r\nNow fear I this will give it start again;\r\nTherefore let's follow.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT V.\r\n\r\nScene I. A churchyard.\r\n\r\n[Enter two Clowns, with spades, &c.]\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nIs she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully\r\nseeks her own salvation?\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nI tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight: the\r\ncrowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nHow can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nWhy, 'tis found so.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nIt must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies\r\nthe point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an\r\nact hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform:\r\nargal, she drowned herself wittingly.\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nNay, but hear you, goodman delver,--\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nGive me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the\r\nman; good: if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,\r\nwill he, nill he, he goes,--mark you that: but if the water come\r\nto him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is\r\nnot guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nBut is this law?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nAy, marry, is't--crowner's quest law.\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nWill you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a\r\ngentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nWhy, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk\r\nshould have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves\r\nmore than their even Christian.--Come, my spade. There is no\r\nancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they\r\nhold up Adam's profession.\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nWas he a gentleman?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nHe was the first that ever bore arms.\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nWhy, he had none.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nWhat, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?\r\nThe Scripture says Adam digg'd: could he dig without arms? I'll\r\nput another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the\r\npurpose, confess thyself,--\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nGo to.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nWhat is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the\r\nshipwright, or the carpenter?\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nThe gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nI like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well;\r\nbut how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now,\r\nthou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the\r\nchurch; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nWho builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nAy, tell me that, and unyoke.\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nMarry, now I can tell.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nTo't.\r\n\r\n2 Clown.\r\nMass, I cannot tell.\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.]\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nCudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will\r\nnot mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this\r\nquestion next, say 'a grave-maker;' the houses he makes last\r\ntill doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\n[Exit Second Clown.]\r\n\r\n[Digs and sings.]\r\n\r\n   In youth when I did love, did love,\r\n     Methought it was very sweet;\r\n   To contract, O, the time for, ah, my behove,\r\n     O, methought there was nothing meet.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHas this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at\r\ngrave-making?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nCustom hath made it in him a property of easiness.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\n[Sings.]\r\n   But age, with his stealing steps,\r\n     Hath claw'd me in his clutch,\r\n   And hath shipp'd me into the land,\r\n     As if I had never been such.\r\n\r\n[Throws up a skull.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThat skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the\r\nknave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that\r\ndid the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician,\r\nwhich this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,\r\nmight it not?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIt might, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nOr of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!\r\nHow dost thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that\r\npraised my lord such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg\r\nit,--might it not?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nAy, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked\r\nabout the mazard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution,\r\nan we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the\r\nbreeding but to play at loggets with 'em? mine ache to think\r\non't.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\n[Sings.]\r\n   A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,\r\n     For and a shrouding sheet;\r\n   O, a pit of clay for to be made\r\n     For such a guest is meet.\r\n\r\n[Throws up another skull].\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThere's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?\r\nWhere be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,\r\nand his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock\r\nhim about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him\r\nof his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a\r\ngreat buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his\r\nfines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of\r\nhis fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine\r\npate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of\r\nhis purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth\r\nof a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will\r\nscarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no\r\nmore, ha?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nNot a jot more, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIs not parchment made of sheep-skins?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nAy, my lord, And of calf-skins too.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThey are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I\r\nwill speak to this fellow.--Whose grave's this, sir?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nMine, sir.\r\n[Sings.]\r\n   O, a pit of clay for to be made\r\n     For such a guest is meet.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nYou lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours: for my part,\r\nI do not lie in't, yet it is mine.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for\r\nthe dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\n'Tis a quick lie, sir; 't will away again from me to you.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat man dost thou dig it for?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nFor no man, sir.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat woman then?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nFor none neither.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWho is to be buried in't?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nOne that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or\r\nequivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three\r\nyears I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that\r\nthe toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he\r\ngalls his kibe.--How long hast thou been a grave-maker?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nOf all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our\r\nlast King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow long is that since?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nCannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was the\r\nvery day that young Hamlet was born,--he that is mad, and sent\r\ninto England.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAy, marry, why was be sent into England?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nWhy, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there;\r\nor, if he do not, it's no great matter there.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\n'Twill not he seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow came he mad?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nVery strangely, they say.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow strangely?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nFaith, e'en with losing his wits.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nUpon what ground?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nWhy, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy,\r\nthirty years.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nFaith, if he be not rotten before he die,--as we have many\r\npocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,--he\r\nwill last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last\r\nyou nine year.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy he more than another?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nWhy, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that he will\r\nkeep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of\r\nyour whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull hath lain\r\nin the earth three-and-twenty years.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhose was it?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nA whoreson, mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNay, I know not.\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nA pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of\r\nRhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's\r\nskull, the king's jester.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThis?\r\n\r\n1 Clown.\r\nE'en that.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nLet me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick!--I knew him,\r\nHoratio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he\r\nhath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred\r\nin my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those\r\nlips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes\r\nnow? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that\r\nwere wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your\r\nown grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now, get you to my lady's\r\nchamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this\r\nfavour she must come; make her laugh at that.--Pr'ythee, Horatio,\r\ntell me one thing.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWhat's that, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nE'en so.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAnd smelt so? Pah!\r\n\r\n[Throws down the skull.]\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nE'en so, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nTo what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not\r\nimagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it\r\nstopping a bung-hole?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\n'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNo, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty\r\nenough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died,\r\nAlexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is\r\nearth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he\r\nwas converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?\r\n   Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,\r\n   Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.\r\n   O, that that earth which kept the world in awe\r\n   Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!\r\nBut soft! but soft! aside!--Here comes the king.\r\n\r\n[Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia,\r\nLaertes, and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?\r\nAnd with such maimed rites? This doth betoken\r\nThe corse they follow did with desperate hand\r\nFordo it own life: 'twas of some estate.\r\nCouch we awhile and mark.\r\n\r\n[Retiring with Horatio.]\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nWhat ceremony else?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThat is Laertes,\r\nA very noble youth: mark.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nWhat ceremony else?\r\n\r\n1 Priest.\r\nHer obsequies have been as far enlarg'd\r\nAs we have warranties: her death was doubtful;\r\nAnd, but that great command o'ersways the order,\r\nShe should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd\r\nTill the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,\r\nShards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her,\r\nYet here she is allowed her virgin rites,\r\nHer maiden strewments, and the bringing home\r\nOf bell and burial.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nMust there no more be done?\r\n\r\n1 Priest.\r\nNo more be done;\r\nWe should profane the service of the dead\r\nTo sing a requiem and such rest to her\r\nAs to peace-parted souls.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nLay her i' the earth;--\r\nAnd from her fair and unpolluted flesh\r\nMay violets spring!--I tell thee, churlish priest,\r\nA ministering angel shall my sister be\r\nWhen thou liest howling.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat, the fair Ophelia?\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nSweets to the sweet: farewell.\r\n[Scattering flowers.]\r\nI hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;\r\nI thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,\r\nAnd not have strew'd thy grave.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nO, treble woe\r\nFall ten times treble on that cursed head\r\nWhose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense\r\nDepriv'd thee of!--Hold off the earth awhile,\r\nTill I have caught her once more in mine arms:\r\n[Leaps into the grave.]\r\nNow pile your dust upon the quick and dead,\r\nTill of this flat a mountain you have made,\r\nTo o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head\r\nOf blue Olympus.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n[Advancing.]\r\nWhat is he whose grief\r\nBears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow\r\nConjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand\r\nLike wonder-wounded hearers? this is I,\r\nHamlet the Dane.\r\n[Leaps into the grave.]\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nThe devil take thy soul!\r\n[Grappling with him.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThou pray'st not well.\r\nI pr'ythee, take thy fingers from my throat;\r\nFor, though I am not splenetive and rash,\r\nYet have I in me something dangerous,\r\nWhich let thy wiseness fear: away thy hand!\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nPluck them asunder.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nHamlet! Hamlet!\r\n\r\nAll.\r\nGentlemen!--\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nGood my lord, be quiet.\r\n\r\n[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, I will fight with him upon this theme\r\nUntil my eyelids will no longer wag.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nO my son, what theme?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI lov'd Ophelia; forty thousand brothers\r\nCould not, with all their quantity of love,\r\nMake up my sum.--What wilt thou do for her?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nO, he is mad, Laertes.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nFor love of God, forbear him!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\n'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:\r\nWoul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?\r\nWoul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?\r\nI'll do't.--Dost thou come here to whine?\r\nTo outface me with leaping in her grave?\r\nBe buried quick with her, and so will I:\r\nAnd, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw\r\nMillions of acres on us, till our ground,\r\nSingeing his pate against the burning zone,\r\nMake Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,\r\nI'll rant as well as thou.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nThis is mere madness:\r\nAnd thus a while the fit will work on him;\r\nAnon, as patient as the female dove,\r\nWhen that her golden couplets are disclos'd,\r\nHis silence will sit drooping.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHear you, sir;\r\nWhat is the reason that you use me thus?\r\nI lov'd you ever: but it is no matter;\r\nLet Hercules himself do what he may,\r\nThe cat will mew, and dog will have his day.\r\n\r\n[Exit.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nI pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.--\r\n\r\n[Exit Horatio.]\r\n[To Laertes]\r\nStrengthen your patience in our last night's speech;\r\nWe'll put the matter to the present push.--\r\nGood Gertrude, set some watch over your son.--\r\nThis grave shall have a living monument:\r\nAn hour of quiet shortly shall we see;\r\nTill then in patience our proceeding be.\r\n\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II. A hall in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSo much for this, sir: now let me see the other;\r\nYou do remember all the circumstance?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nRemember it, my lord!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\r\nThat would not let me sleep: methought I lay\r\nWorse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,\r\nAnd prais'd be rashness for it,--let us know,\r\nOur indiscretion sometime serves us well,\r\nWhen our deep plots do fail; and that should teach us\r\nThere's a divinity that shapes our ends,\r\nRough-hew them how we will.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nThat is most certain.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nUp from my cabin,\r\nMy sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark\r\nGrop'd I to find out them: had my desire;\r\nFinger'd their packet; and, in fine, withdrew\r\nTo mine own room again: making so bold,\r\nMy fears forgetting manners, to unseal\r\nTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,\r\nO royal knavery! an exact command,--\r\nLarded with many several sorts of reasons,\r\nImporting Denmark's health, and England's too,\r\nWith, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,--\r\nThat, on the supervise, no leisure bated,\r\nNo, not to stay the grinding of the axe,\r\nMy head should be struck off.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIs't possible?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHere's the commission: read it at more leisure.\r\nBut wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nI beseech you.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nBeing thus benetted round with villanies,--\r\nOr I could make a prologue to my brains,\r\nThey had begun the play,--I sat me down;\r\nDevis'd a new commission; wrote it fair:\r\nI once did hold it, as our statists do,\r\nA baseness to write fair, and labour'd much\r\nHow to forget that learning; but, sir, now\r\nIt did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know\r\nThe effect of what I wrote?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nAy, good my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAn earnest conjuration from the king,--\r\nAs England was his faithful tributary;\r\nAs love between them like the palm might flourish;\r\nAs peace should still her wheaten garland wear\r\nAnd stand a comma 'tween their amities;\r\nAnd many such-like as's of great charge,--\r\nThat, on the view and know of these contents,\r\nWithout debatement further, more or less,\r\nHe should the bearers put to sudden death,\r\nNot shriving-time allow'd.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nHow was this seal'd?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.\r\nI had my father's signet in my purse,\r\nWhich was the model of that Danish seal:\r\nFolded the writ up in the form of the other;\r\nSubscrib'd it: gave't the impression; plac'd it safely,\r\nThe changeling never known. Now, the next day\r\nWas our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent\r\nThou know'st already.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhy, man, they did make love to this employment;\r\nThey are not near my conscience; their defeat\r\nDoes by their own insinuation grow:\r\n'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes\r\nBetween the pass and fell incensed points\r\nOf mighty opposites.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nWhy, what a king is this!\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nDoes it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon,--\r\nHe that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;\r\nPopp'd in between the election and my hopes;\r\nThrown out his angle for my proper life,\r\nAnd with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience\r\nTo quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd\r\nTo let this canker of our nature come\r\nIn further evil?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIt must be shortly known to him from England\r\nWhat is the issue of the business there.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIt will be short: the interim is mine;\r\nAnd a man's life is no more than to say One.\r\nBut I am very sorry, good Horatio,\r\nThat to Laertes I forgot myself;\r\nFor by the image of my cause I see\r\nThe portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:\r\nBut, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me\r\nInto a towering passion.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nPeace; who comes here?\r\n\r\n[Enter Osric.]\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nYour lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nNo, my good lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He\r\nhath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and\r\nhis crib shall stand at the king's mess; 'tis a chough; but, as I\r\nsay, spacious in the possession of dirt.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nSweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should\r\nimpart a thing to you from his majesty.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your\r\nbonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nI thank your lordship, t'is very hot.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNo, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nIt is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nMethinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nExceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as 'twere--I cannot\r\ntell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that\r\nhe has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the\r\nmatter,--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI beseech you, remember,--\r\n[Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nNay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here\r\nis newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute\r\ngentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft\r\nsociety and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he\r\nis the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the\r\ncontinent of what part a gentleman would see.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;--though, I\r\nknow, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of\r\nmemory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.\r\nBut, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great\r\narticle, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make\r\ntrue diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else\r\nwould trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThe concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more\r\nrawer breath?\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nSir?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIs't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't,\r\nsir, really.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nOf Laertes?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nHis purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nOf him, sir.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nI know, you are not ignorant,--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not\r\nmuch approve me.--Well, sir.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nYou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in\r\nexcellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on\r\nhim by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat's his weapon?\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nRapier and dagger.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThat's two of his weapons:--but well.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nThe king, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses:\r\nagainst the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French\r\nrapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and\r\nso: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,\r\nvery responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of\r\nvery liberal conceit.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nWhat call you the carriages?\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nI knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThe phrase would be more german to the matter if we could\r\ncarry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.\r\nBut, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their\r\nassigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that's the French\r\nbet against the Danish: why is this all imponed, as you call it?\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nThe king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between\r\nyour and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath\r\nlaid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial\r\nif your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow if I answer no?\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nSir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,\r\nit is the breathing time of day with me: let the foils be\r\nbrought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,\r\nI will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my\r\nshame and the odd hits.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nShall I re-deliver you e'en so?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nI commend my duty to your lordship.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nYours, yours.\r\n\r\n[Exit Osric.]\r\n\r\nHe does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else\r\nfor's turn.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHe did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,--and\r\nmany more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,--\r\nonly got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter;\r\na kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and\r\nthrough the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow\r\nthem to their trial, the bubbles are out,\r\n\r\n[Enter a Lord.]\r\n\r\nLord.\r\nMy lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric,\r\nwho brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends\r\nto know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you\r\nwill take longer time.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure:\r\nif his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided\r\nI be so able as now.\r\n\r\nLord.\r\nThe King and Queen and all are coming down.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIn happy time.\r\n\r\nLord.\r\nThe queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to\r\nLaertes before you fall to play.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nShe well instructs me.\r\n\r\n[Exit Lord.]\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nYou will lose this wager, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI do not think so; since he went into France I have been in\r\ncontinual practice: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not\r\nthink how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nNay, good my lord,--\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nIt is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as\r\nwould perhaps trouble a woman.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nIf your mind dislike anything, obey it: I will forestall their\r\nrepair hither, and say you are not fit.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNot a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in\r\nthe fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be\r\nnot to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:\r\nthe readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves,\r\nwhat is't to leave betimes?\r\n\r\n[Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric, and Attendants with\r\nfoils &c.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nCome, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.\r\n\r\n[The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nGive me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong:\r\nBut pardon't, as you are a gentleman.\r\nThis presence knows, and you must needs have heard,\r\nHow I am punish'd with sore distraction.\r\nWhat I have done\r\nThat might your nature, honour, and exception\r\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\r\nWas't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:\r\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,\r\nAnd when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,\r\nThen Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.\r\nWho does it, then? His madness: if't be so,\r\nHamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;\r\nHis madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.\r\nSir, in this audience,\r\nLet my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil\r\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts\r\nThat I have shot my arrow o'er the house\r\nAnd hurt my brother.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nI am satisfied in nature,\r\nWhose motive, in this case, should stir me most\r\nTo my revenge. But in my terms of honour\r\nI stand aloof; and will no reconcilement\r\nTill by some elder masters of known honour\r\nI have a voice and precedent of peace\r\nTo keep my name ungor'd. But till that time\r\nI do receive your offer'd love like love,\r\nAnd will not wrong it.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI embrace it freely;\r\nAnd will this brother's wager frankly play.--\r\nGive us the foils; come on.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nCome, one for me.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance\r\nYour skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,\r\nStick fiery off indeed.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nYou mock me, sir.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNo, by this hand.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,\r\nYou know the wager?\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nVery well, my lord;\r\nYour grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nI do not fear it; I have seen you both;\r\nBut since he's better'd, we have therefore odds.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nThis is too heavy, let me see another.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?\r\n\r\n[They prepare to play.]\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nAy, my good lord.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nSet me the stoups of wine upon that table,--\r\nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit,\r\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\r\nLet all the battlements their ordnance fire;\r\nThe king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;\r\nAnd in the cup an union shall he throw,\r\nRicher than that which four successive kings\r\nIn Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;\r\nAnd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,\r\nThe trumpet to the cannoneer without,\r\nThe cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,\r\n'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.'--Come, begin:--\r\nAnd you, the judges, bear a wary eye.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nCome on, sir.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nCome, my lord.\r\n\r\n[They play.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nOne.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nJudgment!\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nA hit, a very palpable hit.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nWell;--again.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nStay, give me drink.--Hamlet, this pearl is thine;\r\nHere's to thy health.--\r\n\r\n[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.]\r\n\r\nGive him the cup.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.--\r\nCome.--Another hit; what say you?\r\n\r\n[They play.]\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nA touch, a touch, I do confess.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nOur son shall win.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nHe's fat, and scant of breath.--\r\nHere, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:\r\nThe queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nGood madam!\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nGertrude, do not drink.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nI will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\n[Aside.] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nI dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nCome, let me wipe thy face.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nMy lord, I'll hit him now.\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nI do not think't.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\n[Aside.] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nCome, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;\r\nI pray you pass with your best violence:\r\nI am afeard you make a wanton of me.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nSay you so? come on.\r\n\r\n[They play.]\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nNothing, neither way.\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nHave at you now!\r\n\r\n[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they\r\nchange rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nPart them; they are incens'd.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nNay, come again!\r\n\r\n[The Queen falls.]\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nLook to the queen there, ho!\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nThey bleed on both sides.--How is it, my lord?\r\n\r\nOsr.\r\nHow is't, Laertes?\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nWhy, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric;\r\nI am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nHow does the Queen?\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nShe swoons to see them bleed.\r\n\r\nQueen.\r\nNo, no! the drink, the drink!--O my dear Hamlet!--\r\nThe drink, the drink!--I am poison'd.\r\n\r\n[Dies.]\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nO villany!--Ho! let the door be lock'd:\r\nTreachery! seek it out.\r\n\r\n[Laertes falls.]\r\n\r\nLaer.\r\nIt is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;\r\nNo medicine in the world can do thee good;\r\nIn thee there is not half an hour of life;\r\nThe treacherous instrument is in thy hand,\r\nUnbated and envenom'd: the foul practice\r\nHath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,\r\nNever to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:\r\nI can no more:--the king, the king's to blame.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nThe point envenom'd too!--\r\nThen, venom, to thy work.\r\n\r\n[Stabs the King.]\r\n\r\nOsric and Lords.\r\nTreason! treason!\r\n\r\nKing.\r\nO, yet defend me, friends!

I follow thee.--\r\nI am dead, Horatio.--Wretched queen, adieu!--\r\nYou that look pale and tremble at this chance,\r\nThat are but mutes or audience to this act,\r\nHad I but time,--as this fell sergeant, death,\r\nIs strict in his arrest,--O, I could tell you,--\r\nBut let it be.--Horatio, I am dead;\r\nThou liv'st; report me and my cause aright\r\nTo the unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nHor.\r\nNever believe it:\r\nI am more an antique Roman than a Dane.--\r\nHere's yet some liquor left.\r\n\r\nHam.\r\nAs thou'rt a man,\r\nGive me the cup;

Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew\r\n     round-womb'd, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere\r\nshe\r\n     had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?\r\n  Kent. I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so\r\n     proper.\r\n  Glou. But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder\r\nthan\r\n     this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave\r\ncame\r\n     something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet\r\nwas\r\n     his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the\r\n     whoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble\r\ngentleman,\r\n     Edmund?\r\n  Edm. [comes forward] No, my lord.\r\n  Glou. My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable\r\n     friend.\r\n  Edm. My services to your lordship.\r\n  Kent. I must love you, and sue to know you better.\r\n  Edm. Sir, I shall study deserving.\r\n  Glou. He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.\r\n                                                 Sound a sennet.\r\n     The King is coming.\r\n\r\n      Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of\r\n      Albany and Cornwall; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with\r\n                              Followers.\r\n\r\n  Lear. Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.\r\n  Glou. I shall, my liege.\r\n                                 Exeunt [Gloucester and Edmund].\r\n  Lear. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.\r\n     Give me the map there. Know we have divided\r\n     In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent\r\n     To shake all cares and business from our age,\r\n     Conferring them on younger strengths while we\r\n     Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,\r\n     And you, our no less loving son of Albany,\r\n     We have this hour a constant will to publish\r\n     Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife\r\n     May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,\r\n     Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,\r\n     Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,\r\n     And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters\r\n     (Since now we will divest us both of rule,\r\n     Interest of territory, cares of state),\r\n     Which of you shall we say doth love us most?\r\n     That we our largest bounty may extend\r\n     Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,\r\n     Our eldest-born, speak first.\r\n  Gon. Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;\r\n     Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;\r\n     Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;\r\n     No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;\r\n     As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;\r\n     A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.\r\n     Beyond all manner of so much I love you.\r\n  Cor. [aside] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.\r\n  Lear. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,\r\n     With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,\r\n     With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,\r\n     We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue\r\n     Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,\r\n     Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.\r\n  Reg. Sir, I am made\r\n     Of the selfsame metal that my sister is,\r\n     And prize me at her worth. In my true heart\r\n     I find she names my very deed of love;\r\n     Only she comes too short, that I profess\r\n     Myself an enemy to all other joys\r\n     Which the most precious square of sense possesses,\r\n     And find I am alone felicitate\r\n     In your dear Highness' love.\r\n  Cor. [aside] Then poor Cordelia!\r\n     And yet not so; since I am sure my love's\r\n     More richer than my tongue.\r\n  Lear. To thee and thine hereditary ever\r\n     Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,\r\n     No less in space, validity, and pleasure\r\n     Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,\r\n     Although the last, not least; to whose young love\r\n     The vines of France and milk of Burgundy\r\n     Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw\r\n     A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.\r\n  Cor. Nothing, my lord.\r\n  Lear. Nothing?\r\n  Cor. Nothing.\r\n  Lear. Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.\r\n  Cor. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave\r\n     My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty\r\n     According to my bond; no more nor less.\r\n  Lear. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,\r\n     Lest it may mar your fortunes.\r\n  Cor. Good my lord,\r\n     You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I\r\n     Return those duties back as are right fit,\r\n     Obey you, love you, and most honour you.\r\n     Why have my sisters husbands, if they say\r\n     They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,\r\n     That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry\r\n     Half my love with him, half my care and duty.\r\n     Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,\r\n     To love my father all.\r\n  Lear. But goes thy heart with this?\r\n  Cor. Ay, good my lord.\r\n  Lear. So young, and so untender?\r\n  Cor. So young, my lord, and true.\r\n  Lear. Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!\r\n     For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,\r\n     The mysteries of Hecate and the night;\r\n     By all the operation of the orbs\r\n     From whom we do exist and cease to be;\r\n     Here I disclaim all my paternal care,\r\n     Propinquity and property of blood,\r\n     And as a stranger to my heart and me\r\n     Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,\r\n     Or he that makes his generation messes\r\n     To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\r\n     Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,\r\n     As thou my sometime daughter.\r\n  Kent. Good my liege-\r\n  Lear. Peace, Kent!\r\n     Come not between the dragon and his wrath.\r\n     I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest\r\n     On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-\r\n     So be my grave my peace as here I give\r\n     Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?\r\n     Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,\r\n     With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;\r\n     Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.\r\n     I do invest you jointly in my power,\r\n     Preeminence, and all the large effects\r\n     That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,\r\n     With reservation of an hundred knights,\r\n     By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode\r\n     Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain\r\n     The name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway,\r\n     Revenue, execution of the rest,\r\n     Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,\r\n     This coronet part betwixt you.\r\n  Kent. Royal Lear,\r\n     Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,\r\n     Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,\r\n     As my great patron thought on in my prayers-\r\n  Lear. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.\r\n  Kent. Let it fall rather, though the fork invade\r\n     The region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerly\r\n     When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?\r\n     Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak\r\n     When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound\r\n     When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom;\r\n     And in thy best consideration check\r\n     This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,\r\n     Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,\r\n     Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound\r\n     Reverbs no hollowness.\r\n  Lear. Kent, on thy life, no more!\r\n  Kent. My life I never held but as a pawn\r\n     To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,\r\n     Thy safety being the motive.\r\n  Lear. Out of my sight!\r\n  Kent. See better, Lear, and let me still remain\r\n     The true blank of thine eye.\r\n  Lear. Now by Apollo-\r\n  Kent. Now by Apollo, King,\r\n     Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.\r\n  Lear. O vassal! miscreant!\r\n                                   [Lays his hand on his sword.]\r\n  Alb., Corn. Dear sir, forbear!\r\n  Kent. Do!\r\n     Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow\r\n     Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,\r\n     Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,\r\n     I'll tell thee thou dost evil.\r\n  Lear. Hear me, recreant!\r\n     On thine allegiance, hear me!\r\n     Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-\r\n     Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride\r\n     To come between our sentence and our power,-\r\n     Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-\r\n     Our potency made good, take thy reward.\r\n     Five days we do allot thee for provision\r\n     To shield thee from diseases of the world,\r\n     And on the sixth to turn thy hated back\r\n     Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,\r\n     Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,\r\n     The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,\r\n     This shall not be revok'd.\r\n  Kent. Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear,\r\n     Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.\r\n     [To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee,\r\nmaid,\r\n     That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!\r\n     [To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your\r\ndeeds\r\n        approve,\r\n     That good effects may spring from words of love.\r\n     Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;\r\n     He'll shape his old course in a country new.\r\nExit.\r\n\r\n  Flourish. Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy;\r\nAttendants.\r\n\r\n  Glou. Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.\r\n  Lear. My Lord of Burgundy,\r\n     We first address toward you, who with this king\r\n     Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the least\r\n     Will you require in present dower with her,\r\n     Or cease your quest of love?\r\n  Bur. Most royal Majesty,\r\n     I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,\r\n     Nor will you tender less.\r\n  Lear. Right noble Burgundy,\r\n     When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;\r\n     But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.\r\n     If aught within that little seeming substance,\r\n     Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,\r\n     And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,\r\n     She's there, and she is yours.\r\n  Bur. I know no answer.\r\n  Lear. Will you, with those infirmities she owes,\r\n     Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,\r\n     Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,\r\n     Take her, or leave her?\r\n  Bur. Pardon me, royal sir.\r\n     Election makes not up on such conditions.\r\n  Lear. Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,\r\n     I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,\r\n     I would not from your love make such a stray\r\n     To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you\r\n     T' avert your liking a more worthier way\r\n     Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd\r\n     Almost t' acknowledge hers.\r\n  France. This is most strange,\r\n     That she that even but now was your best object,\r\n     The argument of your praise, balm of your age,\r\n     Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time\r\n     Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle\r\n     So many folds of favour. Sure her offence\r\n     Must be of such unnatural degree\r\n     That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection\r\n     Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her\r\n     Must be a faith that reason without miracle\r\n     Should never plant in me.\r\n  Cor. I yet beseech your Majesty,\r\n     If for I want that glib and oily art\r\n     To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,\r\n     I'll do't before I speak- that you make known\r\n     It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,\r\n     No unchaste action or dishonoured step,\r\n     That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;\r\n     But even for want of that for which I am richer-\r\n     A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue\r\n     As I am glad I have not, though not to have it\r\n     Hath lost me in your liking.\r\n  Lear. Better thou\r\n     Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better.\r\n  France. Is it but this- a tardiness in nature\r\n     Which often leaves the history unspoke\r\n     That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,\r\n     What say you to the lady? Love's not love\r\n     When it is mingled with regards that stands\r\n     Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?\r\n     She is herself a dowry.\r\n  Bur. Royal Lear,\r\n     Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,\r\n     And here I take Cordelia by the hand,\r\n     Duchess of Burgundy.\r\n  Lear. Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.\r\n  Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a father\r\n     That you must lose a husband.\r\n  Cor. Peace be with Burgundy!\r\n     Since that respects of fortune are his love,\r\n     I shall not be his wife.\r\n  France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;\r\n     Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!\r\n     Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon.\r\n     Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.\r\n     Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect\r\n     My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.\r\n     Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,\r\n     Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.\r\n     Not all the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy\r\n     Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.\r\n     Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.\r\n     Thou losest here, a better where to find.\r\n  Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we\r\n     Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see\r\n     That face of hers again. Therefore be gone\r\n     Without our grace, our love, our benison.\r\n     Come, noble Burgundy.\r\n             Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, [Cornwall, Albany,\r\n                                    Gloucester, and Attendants].\r\n  France. Bid farewell to your sisters.\r\n  Cor. The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes\r\n     Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are;\r\n     And, like a sister, am most loath to call\r\n     Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father.\r\n     To your professed bosoms I commit him;\r\n     But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,\r\n     I would prefer him to a better place!\r\n     So farewell to you both.\r\n  Gon. Prescribe not us our duties.\r\n  Reg. Let your study\r\n     Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you\r\n     At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,\r\n     And well are worth the want that you have wanted.\r\n  Cor. Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.\r\n     Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.\r\n     Well may you prosper!\r\n  France. Come, my fair Cordelia.\r\n                                     Exeunt France and Cordelia.\r\n  Gon. Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly\r\n     appertains to us both. I think our father will hence\r\nto-night.\r\n  Reg. That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.\r\n  Gon. You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we\r\n     have made of it hath not been little. He always lov'd our\r\n     sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast\r\nher\r\n     off appears too grossly.\r\n  Reg. 'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but\r\nslenderly\r\n     known himself.\r\n  Gon. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then\r\n     must we look to receive from his age, not alone the\r\n     imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal\r\n     the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring\r\nwith\r\n     them.\r\n  Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as\r\nthis\r\n     of Kent's banishment.\r\n  Gon. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France\r\nand\r\n     him. Pray you let's hit together. If our father carry\r\nauthority\r\n     with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of\r\nhis\r\n     will but offend us.\r\n  Reg. We shall further think on't.\r\n  Gon. We must do something, and i' th' heat.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II.\r\nThe Earl of Gloucester's Castle.\r\n\r\nEnter [Edmund the] Bastard solus, [with a letter].\r\n\r\n  Edm. Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law\r\n     My services are bound. Wherefore should I\r\n     Stand in the plague of custom, and permit\r\n     The curiosity of nations to deprive me,\r\n     For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines\r\n     Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?\r\n     When my dimensions are as well compact,\r\n     My mind as generous, and my shape as true,\r\n     As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us\r\n     With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?\r\n     Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take\r\n     More composition and fierce quality\r\n     Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,\r\n     Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops\r\n     Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,\r\n     Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.\r\n     Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund\r\n     As to th' legitimate. Fine word- 'legitimate'!\r\n     Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,\r\n     And my invention thrive, Edmund the base\r\n     Shall top th' legitimate. I grow; I prosper.\r\n     Now, gods, stand up for bastards!\r\n\r\n                          Enter Gloucester.\r\n\r\n  Glou. Kent banish'd thus? and France in choler parted?\r\n     And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r?\r\n     Confin'd to exhibition? All this done\r\n     Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?\r\n  Edm. So please your lordship, none.\r\n                                           [Puts up the letter.]\r\n  Glou. Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?\r\n  Edm. I know no news, my lord.\r\n  Glou. What paper were you reading?\r\n  Edm. Nothing, my lord.\r\n  Glou. No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into\r\nyour\r\n     pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide\r\n     itself. Let's see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need\r\n     spectacles.\r\n  Edm. I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my\r\nbrother\r\n     that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have\r\n     perus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.\r\n  Glou. Give me the letter, sir.\r\n  Edm. I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents,\r\nas\r\n     in part I understand them, are to blame.\r\n  Glou. Let's see, let's see!\r\n  Edm. I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but\r\nas\r\n     an essay or taste of my virtue.\r\n\r\n  Glou. (reads) 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world\r\n     bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us\r\n     till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle\r\n     and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who\r\nsways,\r\n     not as it hath power, but as it is suffer'd. Come to me,\r\nthat\r\n     of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I\r\n     wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and\r\nlive\r\n     the beloved of your brother,\r\n                                                        'EDGAR.'\r\n\r\n     Hum! Conspiracy? 'Sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy\r\nhalf\r\n     his revenue.' My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a\r\nheart\r\n     and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought\r\nit?\r\n  Edm. It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it.\r\nI\r\n     found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.\r\n  Glou. You know the character to be your brother's?\r\n  Edm. If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were\r\nhis;\r\n     but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.\r\n  Glou. It is his.\r\n  Edm. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in\r\nthe\r\n     contents.\r\n  Glou. Hath he never before sounded you in this business?\r\n  Edm. Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be\r\nfit\r\n     that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father\r\n     should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his\r\nrevenue.\r\n  Glou. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter!\r\nAbhorred\r\n     villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than\r\n     brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I'll apprehend him.\r\nAbominable\r\n     villain! Where is he?\r\n  Edm. I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to\r\nsuspend\r\n     your indignation against my brother till you can derive from\r\nhim\r\n     better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain\r\ncourse;\r\n     where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his\r\n     purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and\r\nshake\r\n     in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my\r\nlife\r\n     for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your\r\n     honour, and to no other pretence of danger.\r\n  Glou. Think you so?\r\n  Edm. If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you\r\nshall\r\n     hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have\r\nyour\r\n     satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this\r\nvery\r\n     evening.\r\n  Glou. He cannot be such a monster.\r\n  Edm. Nor is not, sure.\r\n  Glou. To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.\r\n     Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I\r\npray\r\n     you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would\r\nunstate\r\n     myself to be in a due resolution.\r\n  Edm. I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I\r\n     shall find means, and acquaint you withal.\r\n  Glou. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good\r\nto\r\n     us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus,\r\nyet\r\n     nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects. Love\r\ncools,\r\n     friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies;\r\nin\r\n     countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond\r\ncrack'd\r\n     'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the\r\n     prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from\r\nbias\r\n     of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the\r\nbest\r\n     of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all\r\n     ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find\r\nout\r\n     this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it\r\n     carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! his\r\n     offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.                       Exit.\r\n  Edm. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we\r\nare\r\n     sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we\r\nmake\r\n     guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as\r\nif\r\n     we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;\r\n     knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;\r\n     drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of\r\n     planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a\r\ndivine\r\n     thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to\r\nlay\r\n     his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father\r\n     compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my\r\n     nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough\r\nand\r\n     lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the\r\n     maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my\r\nbastardizing.\r\n     Edgar-\r\n\r\n                             Enter Edgar.\r\n\r\n     and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy.\r\nMy\r\n     cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o'\r\nBedlam.\r\n     O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la,\r\nmi.\r\n  Edg. How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are\r\nyou\r\n     in?\r\n  Edm. I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other\r\nday,\r\n     what should follow these eclipses.\r\n  Edg. Do you busy yourself with that?\r\n  Edm. I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily:\r\nas\r\n     of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,\r\n     dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,\r\n     menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless\r\n     diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,\r\n     nuptial breaches, and I know not what.\r\n  Edg. How long have you been a sectary astronomical?\r\n  Edm. Come, come! When saw you my father last?\r\n  Edg. The night gone by.\r\n  Edm. Spake you with him?\r\n  Edg. Ay, two hours together.\r\n  Edm. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him\r\nby\r\n     word or countenance\r\n  Edg. None at all.\r\n  Edm. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at\r\nmy\r\n     entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath\r\n     qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant\r\nso\r\n     rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would\r\n     scarcely allay.\r\n  Edg. Some villain hath done me wrong.\r\n  Edm. That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance\r\ntill\r\n     the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire\r\nwith me\r\n     to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my\r\n     lord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. If you do stir\r\nabroad,\r\n     go arm'd.\r\n  Edg. Arm'd, brother?\r\n  Edm. Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no\r\nhonest man\r\n     if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you\r\nwhat I\r\n     have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and\r\n     horror of it. Pray you, away!\r\n  Edg. Shall I hear from you anon?\r\n  Edm. I do serve you in this business.\r\n                                                     Exit Edgar.\r\n     A credulous father! and a brother noble,\r\n     Whose nature is so far from doing harms\r\n     That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty\r\n     My practices ride easy! I see the business.\r\n     Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;\r\n     All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.\r\nExit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III.\r\nThe Duke of Albany's Palace.\r\n\r\nEnter Goneril and [her] Steward [Oswald].\r\n\r\n  Gon. Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?\r\n  Osw. Ay, madam.\r\n  Gon. By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour\r\n     He flashes into one gross crime or other\r\n     That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.\r\n     His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us\r\n     On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,\r\n     I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.\r\n     If you come slack of former services,\r\n     You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.\r\n                                                 [Horns within.]\r\n  Osw. He's coming, madam; I hear him.\r\n  Gon. Put on what weary negligence you please,\r\n     You and your fellows. I'd have it come to question.\r\n     If he distaste it, let him to our sister,\r\n     Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,\r\n     Not to be overrul'd. Idle old man,\r\n     That still would manage those authorities\r\n     That he hath given away! Now, by my life,\r\n     Old fools are babes again, and must be us'd\r\n     With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd.\r\n     Remember what I have said.\r\n  Osw. Very well, madam.\r\n  Gon. And let his knights have colder looks among you.\r\n     What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.\r\n     I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,\r\n     That I may speak. I'll write straight to my sister\r\n     To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV.\r\nThe Duke of Albany's Palace.\r\n\r\nEnter Kent, [disguised].\r\n\r\n  Kent. If but as well I other accents borrow,\r\n     That can my speech defuse, my good intent\r\n     May carry through itself to that full issue\r\n     For which I raz'd my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,\r\n     If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,\r\n     So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st,\r\n     Shall find thee full of labours.\r\n\r\n         Horns within. Enter Lear, [Knights,] and Attendants.\r\n\r\n  Lear. Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready. [Exit\r\n     an Attendant.] How now? What art thou?\r\n  Kent. A man, sir.\r\n  Lear. What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?\r\n  Kent. I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him\r\ntruly\r\n     that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to\r\n     converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear\r\n     judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.\r\n  Lear. What art thou?\r\n  Kent. A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King.\r\n  Lear. If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king,\r\nthou\r\n     art poor enough. What wouldst thou?\r\n  Kent. Service.\r\n  Lear. Who wouldst thou serve?\r\n  Kent. You.\r\n  Lear. Dost thou know me, fellow?\r\n  Kent. No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I\r\nwould\r\n     fain call master.\r\n  Lear. What's that?\r\n  Kent. Authority.\r\n  Lear. What services canst thou do?\r\n  Kent. I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale\r\nin\r\n     telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which\r\n     ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of\r\nme\r\n     is diligence.\r\n  Lear. How old art thou?\r\n  Kent. Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so\r\nold to\r\n     dote on her for anything. I have years on my back\r\nforty-eight.\r\n  Lear. Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse\r\nafter\r\n     dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner!\r\n     Where's my knave? my fool? Go you and call my fool hither.\r\n\r\n                                            [Exit an attendant.]\r\n\r\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\r\n\r\n     You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?\r\n  Osw. So please you-                                      Exit.\r\n  Lear. What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.\r\n     [Exit a Knight.] Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's\r\n     asleep.\r\n\r\n                            [Enter Knight]\r\n\r\n     How now? Where's that mongrel?\r\n  Knight. He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.\r\n  Lear. Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him?\r\n  Knight. Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would\r\nnot.\r\n  Lear. He would not?\r\n  Knight. My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my\r\njudgment\r\n     your Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious\r\naffection\r\n     as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness\r\nappears\r\n     as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself\r\nalso\r\n     and your daughter.\r\n  Lear. Ha! say'st thou so?\r\n  Knight. I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for\r\n     my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd.\r\n  Lear. Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I have\r\n     perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather\r\n     blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence\r\n     and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into't. But\r\n     where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days.\r\n  Knight. Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool\r\n     hath much pined away.\r\n  Lear. No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my\r\n     daughter I would speak with her. [Exit Knight.] Go you, call\r\n     hither my fool.\r\n                                            [Exit an Attendant.]\r\n\r\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\r\n\r\n     O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?\r\n  Osw. My lady's father.\r\n  Lear. 'My lady's father'? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog!\r\nyou\r\n     slave! you cur!\r\n  Osw. I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.\r\n  Lear. Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?\r\n                                                  [Strikes him.]\r\n  Osw. I'll not be strucken, my lord.\r\n  Kent. Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?\r\n                                            [Trips up his heels.\r\n  Lear. I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love\r\nthee.\r\n  Kent. Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences. Away,\r\n     away! If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry;\r\nbut\r\n     away! Go to! Have you wisdom? So.\r\n                                               [Pushes him out.]\r\n  Lear. Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's earnest of\r\nthy\r\n     service.                                     [Gives money.]\r\n\r\n                             Enter Fool.\r\n\r\n  Fool. Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb.\r\n                                          [Offers Kent his cap.]\r\n  Lear. How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?\r\n  Fool. Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.\r\n  Kent. Why, fool?\r\n  Fool. Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an\r\nthou\r\n     canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold\r\nshortly.\r\n     There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish'd two\r\non's\r\n     daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If\r\n     thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now,\r\n     nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!\r\n  Lear. Why, my boy?\r\n  Fool. If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs\r\nmyself.\r\n     There's mine! beg another of thy daughters.\r\n  Lear. Take heed, sirrah- the whip.\r\n  Fool. Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out,\r\nwhen\r\n     Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink.\r\n  Lear. A pestilent gall to me!\r\n  Fool. Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.\r\n  Lear. Do.\r\n  Fool. Mark it, nuncle.\r\n          Have more than thou showest,\r\n          Speak less than thou knowest,\r\n          Lend less than thou owest,\r\n          Ride more than thou goest,\r\n          Learn more than thou trowest,\r\n          Set less than thou throwest;\r\n          Leave thy drink and thy whore,\r\n          And keep in-a-door,\r\n          And thou shalt have more\r\n          Than two tens to a score.\r\n  Kent. This is nothing, fool.\r\n  Fool. Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave\r\nme\r\n     nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?\r\n  Lear. Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.\r\n  Fool. [to Kent] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land\r\n     comes to. He will not believe a fool.\r\n  Lear. A bitter fool!\r\n  Fool. Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter\r\n     fool and a sweet fool?\r\n  Lear. No, lad; teach me.\r\n  Fool.   That lord that counsell'd thee\r\n            To give away thy land,\r\n          Come place him here by me-\r\n            Do thou for him stand.\r\n          The sweet and bitter fool\r\n            Will presently appear;\r\n          The one in motley here,\r\n            The other found out there.\r\n  Lear. Dost thou call me fool, boy?\r\n  Fool. All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast\r\n     born with.\r\n  Kent. This is not altogether fool, my lord.\r\n  Fool. No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had\r\na\r\n     monopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies too,\r\nthey\r\n     will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be\r\n     snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two\r\n     crowns.\r\n  Lear. What two crowns shall they be?\r\n  Fool. Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up\r\nthe\r\n     meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown\r\ni'\r\n     th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass\r\non\r\n     thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald\r\ncrown\r\n     when thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself\r\nin\r\n     this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so.\r\n\r\n     [Sings]    Fools had ne'er less grace in a year,\r\n                  For wise men are grown foppish;\r\n                They know not how their wits to wear,\r\n                  Their manners are so apish.\r\n\r\n  Lear. When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?\r\n  Fool. I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy\r\ndaughters\r\n     thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st\r\ndown\r\n     thine own breeches,\r\n\r\n     [Sings]    Then they for sudden joy did weep,\r\n                  And I for sorrow sung,\r\n                That such a king should play bo-peep\r\n                  And go the fools among.\r\n\r\n     Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool\r\nto\r\n     lie. I would fain learn to lie.\r\n  Lear. An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.\r\n  Fool. I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll\r\nhave me\r\n     whipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for\r\nlying;\r\n     and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. I had\r\nrather be\r\n     any kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee,\r\n     nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left\r\nnothing\r\n     i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings.\r\n\r\n                            Enter Goneril.\r\n\r\n  Lear. How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks\r\nyou\r\n     are too much o' late i' th' frown.\r\n  Fool. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care\r\nfor\r\n     her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am\r\nbetter\r\n     than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing.\r\n     [To Goneril] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your\r\nface\r\n     bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum!\r\n\r\n            He that keeps nor crust nor crum,\r\n            Weary of all, shall want some.-\r\n\r\n     [Points at Lear] That's a sheal'd peascod.\r\n  Gon. Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,\r\n     But other of your insolent retinue\r\n     Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth\r\n     In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,\r\n     I had thought, by making this well known unto you,\r\n     To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,\r\n     By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,\r\n     That you protect this course, and put it on\r\n     By your allowance; which if you should, the fault\r\n     Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,\r\n     Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,\r\n     Might in their working do you that offence\r\n     Which else were shame, that then necessity\r\n     Must call discreet proceeding.\r\n  Fool. For you know, nuncle,\r\n\r\n          The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long\r\n          That it had it head bit off by it young.\r\n\r\n     So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.\r\n  Lear. Are you our daughter?\r\n  Gon. Come, sir,\r\n     I would you would make use of that good wisdom\r\n     Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away\r\n     These dispositions that of late transform you\r\n     From what you rightly are.\r\n  Fool. May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?\r\n     Whoop, Jug, I love thee!\r\n  Lear. Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.\r\n     Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?\r\n     Either his notion weakens, his discernings\r\n     Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!\r\n     Who is it that can tell me who I am?\r\n  Fool. Lear's shadow.\r\n  Lear. I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,\r\n     Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded\r\n     I had daughters.\r\n  Fool. Which they will make an obedient father.\r\n  Lear. Your name, fair gentlewoman?\r\n  Gon. This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour\r\n     Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you\r\n     To understand my purposes aright.\r\n     As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.\r\n     Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;\r\n     Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold\r\n     That this our court, infected with their manners,\r\n     Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust\r\n     Make it more like a tavern or a brothel\r\n     Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak\r\n     For instant remedy. Be then desir'd\r\n     By her that else will take the thing she begs\r\n     A little to disquantity your train,\r\n     And the remainder that shall still depend\r\n     To be such men as may besort your age,\r\n     Which know themselves, and you.\r\n  Lear. Darkness and devils!\r\n     Saddle my horses! Call my train together!\r\n     Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee;\r\n     Yet have I left a daughter.\r\n  Gon. You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble\r\n     Make servants of their betters.\r\n\r\n                            Enter Albany.\r\n\r\n  Lear. Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come?\r\n     Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.\r\n     Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,\r\n     More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child\r\n     Than the sea-monster!\r\n  Alb. Pray, sir, be patient.\r\n  Lear. [to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest!\r\n     My train are men of choice and rarest parts,\r\n     That all particulars of duty know\r\n     And in the most exact regard support\r\n     The worships of their name.- O most small fault,\r\n     How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!\r\n     Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature\r\n     From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love\r\n     And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!\r\n     Beat at this gate that let thy folly in  [Strikes his head.]\r\n     And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.\r\n  Alb. My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant\r\n     Of what hath mov'd you.\r\n  Lear. It may be so, my lord.\r\n     Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!\r\n     Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend\r\n     To make this creature fruitful.\r\n     Into her womb convey sterility;\r\n     Dry up in her the organs of increase;\r\n     And from her derogate body never spring\r\n     A babe to honour her! If she must teem,\r\n     Create her child of spleen, that it may live\r\n     And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.\r\n     Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,\r\n     With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,\r\n     Turn all her mother's pains and benefits\r\n     To laughter and contempt, that she may feel\r\n     How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is\r\n     To have a thankless child! Away, away!                Exit.\r\n  Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?\r\n  Gon. Never afflict yourself to know the cause;\r\n     But let his disposition have that scope\r\n     That dotage gives it.\r\n\r\n                             Enter Lear.\r\n\r\n  Lear. What, fifty of my followers at a clap?\r\n     Within a fortnight?\r\n  Alb. What's the matter, sir?\r\n  Lear. I'll tell thee. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd\r\n     That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;\r\n     That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,\r\n     Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!\r\n     Th' untented woundings of a father's curse\r\n     Pierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes,\r\n     Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,\r\n     And cast you, with the waters that you lose,\r\n     To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?\r\n     Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter,\r\n     Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.\r\n     When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails\r\n     She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find\r\n     That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think\r\n     I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.\r\n                            Exeunt [Lear, Kent, and Attendants].\r\n  Gon. Do you mark that, my lord?\r\n  Alb. I cannot be so partial, Goneril,\r\n     To the great love I bear you -\r\n  Gon. Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho!\r\n     [To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your\r\nmaster!\r\n  Fool. Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n          A fox when one has caught her,\r\n          And such a daughter,\r\n          Should sure to the slaughter,\r\n          If my cap would buy a halter.\r\n          So the fool follows after.                       Exit.\r\n  Gon. This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights?\r\n     'Tis politic and safe to let him keep\r\n     At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream,\r\n     Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,\r\n     He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs\r\n     And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!\r\n  Alb. Well, you may fear too far.\r\n  Gon. Safer than trust too far.\r\n     Let me still take away the harms I fear,\r\n     Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart.\r\n     What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister.\r\n     If she sustain him and his hundred knights,\r\n     When I have show'd th' unfitness-\r\n\r\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\r\n\r\n     How now, Oswald?\r\n     What, have you writ that letter to my sister?\r\n  Osw. Yes, madam.\r\n  Gon. Take you some company, and away to horse!\r\n     Inform her full of my particular fear,\r\n     And thereto add such reasons of your own\r\n     As may compact it more. Get you gone,\r\n     And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord!\r\n     This milky gentleness and course of yours,\r\n     Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon,\r\n     You are much more at task for want of wisdom\r\n     Than prais'd for harmful mildness.\r\n  Alb. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.\r\n     Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.\r\n  Gon. Nay then-\r\n  Alb. Well, well; th' event.                            Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene V.\r\nCourt before the Duke of Albany's Palace.\r\n\r\nEnter Lear, Kent, and Fool.\r\n\r\n  Lear. Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint\r\nmy\r\n     daughter no further with anything you know than comes from\r\nher\r\n     demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I\r\n     shall be there afore you.\r\n  Kent. I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your\r\nletter.\r\nExit.\r\n  Fool. If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger\r\nof\r\n     kibes?\r\n  Lear. Ay, boy.\r\n  Fool. Then I prithee be merry. Thy wit shall ne'er go\r\nslip-shod.\r\n  Lear. Ha, ha, ha!\r\n  Fool. Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for\r\nthough\r\n     she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell\r\n     what I can tell.\r\n  Lear. What canst tell, boy?\r\n  Fool. She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou\r\n     canst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle on's face?\r\n  Lear. No.\r\n  Fool. Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what\r\na\r\n     man cannot smell out, 'a may spy into.\r\n  Lear. I did her wrong.\r\n  Fool. Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?\r\n  Lear. No.\r\n  Fool. Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.\r\n  Lear. Why?\r\n  Fool. Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his\r\ndaughters,\r\n     and leave his horns without a case.\r\n  Lear. I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses\r\n     ready?\r\n  Fool. Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven\r\nstars\r\n     are no moe than seven is a pretty reason.\r\n  Lear. Because they are not eight?\r\n  Fool. Yes indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool.\r\n  Lear. To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!\r\n  Fool. If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for\r\nbeing\r\n     old before thy time.\r\n  Lear. How's that?\r\n  Fool. Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been\r\nwise.\r\n  Lear. O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!\r\n     Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!\r\n\r\n                         [Enter a Gentleman.]\r\n\r\n     How now? Are the horses ready?\r\n  Gent. Ready, my lord.\r\n  Lear. Come, boy.\r\n  Fool. She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,\r\n     Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

Scene I.\r\nA court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nEnter [Edmund the] Bastard and Curan, meeting.\r\n\r\n  Edm. Save thee, Curan.\r\n  Cur. And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him\r\n     notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will\r\nbe\r\n     here with him this night.\r\n  Edm. How comes that?\r\n  Cur. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean\r\nthe\r\n     whisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?\r\n  Edm. Not I. Pray you, what are they?\r\n  Cur. Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two\r\nDukes\r\n     of Cornwall and Albany?\r\n  Edm. Not a word.\r\n  Cur. You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.      Exit.\r\n  Edm. The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!\r\n     This weaves itself perforce into my business.\r\n     My father hath set guard to take my brother;\r\n     And I have one thing, of a queasy question,\r\n     Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work!\r\n     Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say!\r\n\r\n                             Enter Edgar.\r\n\r\n     My father watches. O sir, fly this place!\r\n     Intelligence is given where you are hid.\r\n     You have now the good advantage of the night.\r\n     Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?\r\n     He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,\r\n     And Regan with him. Have you nothing said\r\n     Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?\r\n     Advise yourself.\r\n  Edg. I am sure on't, not a word.\r\n  Edm. I hear my father coming. Pardon me!\r\n     In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.\r\n     Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.-\r\n     Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!\r\n     Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.\r\n                                                     Exit Edgar.\r\n     Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion\r\n     Of my more fierce endeavour. [Stabs his arm.] I have seen\r\n        drunkards\r\n     Do more than this in sport.- Father, father!-\r\n     Stop, stop! No help?\r\n\r\n             Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.\r\n\r\n  Glou. Now, Edmund, where's the villain?\r\n  Edm. Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,\r\n     Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon\r\n     To stand 's auspicious mistress.\r\n  Glou. But where is he?\r\n  Edm. Look, sir, I bleed.\r\n  Glou. Where is the villain, Edmund?\r\n  Edm. Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-\r\n  Glou. Pursue him, ho! Go after.        [Exeunt some Servants].\r\n     By no means what?\r\n  Edm. Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;\r\n     But that I told him the revenging gods\r\n     'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;\r\n     Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond\r\n     The child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine,\r\n     Seeing how loathly opposite I stood\r\n     To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion\r\n     With his prepared sword he charges home\r\n     My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;\r\n     But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,\r\n     Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to th' encounter,\r\n     Or whether gasted by the noise I made,\r\n     Full suddenly he fled.\r\n  Glou. Let him fly far.\r\n     Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;\r\n     And found- dispatch. The noble Duke my master,\r\n     My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night.\r\n     By his authority I will proclaim it\r\n     That he which find, him shall deserve our thanks,\r\n     Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;\r\n     He that conceals him, death.\r\n  Edm. When I dissuaded him from his intent\r\n     And found him pight to do it, with curst speech\r\n     I threaten'd to discover him. He replied,\r\n     'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,\r\n     If I would stand against thee, would the reposal\r\n     Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee\r\n     Make thy words faith'd? No. What I should deny\r\n     (As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce\r\n     My very character), I'ld turn it all\r\n     To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;\r\n     And thou must make a dullard of the world,\r\n     If they not thought the profits of my death\r\n     Were very pregnant and potential spurs\r\n     To make thee seek it.'\r\n  Glou. Strong and fast'ned villain!\r\n     Would he deny his letter? I never got him.\r\n                                                  Tucket within.\r\n     Hark, the Duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.\r\n     All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;\r\n     The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture\r\n     I will send far and near, that all the kingdom\r\n     May have due note of him, and of my land,\r\n     Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means\r\n     To make thee capable.\r\n\r\n                Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.\r\n\r\n  Corn. How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither\r\n     (Which I can call but now) I have heard strange news.\r\n  Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short\r\n     Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?\r\n  Glou. O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!\r\n  Reg. What, did my father's godson seek your life?\r\n     He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?\r\n  Glou. O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!\r\n  Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knights\r\n     That tend upon my father?\r\n  Glou. I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!\r\n  Edm. Yes, madam, he was of that consort.\r\n  Reg. No marvel then though he were ill affected.\r\n     'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,\r\n     To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.\r\n     I have this present evening from my sister\r\n     Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions\r\n     That, if they come to sojourn at my house,\r\n     I'll not be there.\r\n  Corn. Nor I, assure thee, Regan.\r\n     Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father\r\n     A childlike office.\r\n  Edm. 'Twas my duty, sir.\r\n  Glou. He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd\r\n     This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.\r\n  Corn. Is he pursued?\r\n  Glou. Ay, my good lord.\r\n  Corn. If he be taken, he shall never more\r\n     Be fear'd of doing harm. Make your own purpose,\r\n     How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,\r\n     Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant\r\n     So much commend itself, you shall be ours.\r\n     Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;\r\n     You we first seize on.\r\n  Edm. I shall serve you, sir,\r\n     Truly, however else.\r\n  Glou. For him I thank your Grace.\r\n  Corn. You know not why we came to visit you-\r\n  Reg. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.\r\n     Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,\r\n     Wherein we must have use of your advice.\r\n     Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,\r\n     Of differences, which I best thought it fit\r\n     To answer from our home. The several messengers\r\n     From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,\r\n     Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow\r\n     Your needful counsel to our business,\r\n     Which craves the instant use.\r\n  Glou. I serve you, madam.\r\n     Your Graces are right welcome.\r\n                                               Exeunt. Flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II.\r\nBefore Gloucester's Castle.\r\n\r\nEnter Kent and [Oswald the] Steward, severally.\r\n\r\n  Osw. Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?\r\n  Kent. Ay.\r\n  Osw. Where may we set our horses?\r\n  Kent. I' th' mire.\r\n  Osw. Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.\r\n  Kent. I love thee not.\r\n  Osw. Why then, I care not for thee.\r\n  Kent. If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care\r\nfor\r\n     me.\r\n  Osw. Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.\r\n  Kent. Fellow, I know thee.\r\n  Osw. What dost thou know me for?\r\n  Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base,\r\nproud,\r\n     shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,\r\n     worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking,\r\nwhoreson,\r\n     glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue;\r\n     one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in\r\nway of\r\n     good service, and art nothing but the composition of a\r\nknave,\r\n     beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel\r\nbitch;\r\n     one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny\r\nthe\r\n     least syllable of thy addition.\r\n  Osw. Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one\r\n     that's neither known of thee nor knows thee!\r\n  Kent. What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest\r\nme!\r\n     Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy\r\nheels\r\n     before the King? [Draws his sword.] Draw, you rogue! for,\r\nthough\r\n     it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th'\r\n     moonshine o' you. Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger!\r\n     draw!\r\n  Osw. Away! I have nothing to do with thee.\r\n  Kent. Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King,\r\nand\r\n     take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her\r\nfather.\r\n     Draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks! Draw, you\r\n     rascal! Come your ways!\r\n  Osw. Help, ho! murther! help!\r\n  Kent. Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave!\r\n     Strike!                                        [Beats him.]\r\n  Osw. Help, ho! murther! murther!\r\n\r\n      Enter Edmund, with his rapier drawn, Gloucester, Cornwall,\r\n                           Regan, Servants.\r\n\r\n  Edm. How now? What's the matter?                 Parts [them].\r\n  Kent. With you, goodman boy, an you please! Come, I'll flesh\r\nye!\r\n     Come on, young master!\r\n  Glou. Weapons? arms? What's the matter here?\r\n  Corn. Keep peace, upon your lives!\r\n     He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?\r\n  Reg. The messengers from our sister and the King\r\n  Corn. What is your difference? Speak.\r\n  Osw. I am scarce in breath, my lord.\r\n  Kent. No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You\r\ncowardly\r\n     rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.\r\n  Corn. Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?\r\n  Kent. Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not\r\nhave\r\n     made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the\r\ntrade.\r\n  Corn. Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?\r\n  Osw. This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd\r\n     At suit of his grey beard-\r\n  Kent. Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if\r\n     you'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain\r\ninto\r\n     mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. 'Spare my\r\ngrey\r\n     beard,' you wagtail?\r\n  Corn. Peace, sirrah!\r\n     You beastly knave, know you no reverence?\r\n  Kent. Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.\r\n  Corn. Why art thou angry?\r\n  Kent. That such a slave as this should wear a sword,\r\n     Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,\r\n     Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain\r\n     Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion\r\n     That in the natures of their lords rebel,\r\n     Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;\r\n     Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks\r\n     With every gale and vary of their masters,\r\n     Knowing naught (like dogs) but following.\r\n     A plague upon your epileptic visage!\r\n     Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?\r\n     Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,\r\n     I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.\r\n  Corn. What, art thou mad, old fellow?\r\n  Glou. How fell you out? Say that.\r\n  Kent. No contraries hold more antipathy\r\n     Than I and such a knave.\r\n  Corn. Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?\r\n  Kent. His countenance likes me not.\r\n  Corn. No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.\r\n  Kent. Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.\r\n     I have seen better faces in my time\r\n     Than stands on any shoulder that I see\r\n     Before me at this instant.\r\n  Corn. This is some fellow\r\n     Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect\r\n     A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb\r\n     Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he!\r\n     An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth!\r\n     An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.\r\n     These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness\r\n     Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends\r\n     Than twenty silly-ducking observants\r\n     That stretch their duties nicely.\r\n  Kent. Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,\r\n     Under th' allowance of your great aspect,\r\n     Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire\r\n     On flickering Phoebus' front-\r\n  Corn. What mean'st by this?\r\n  Kent. To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I\r\n     know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil'd you in a\r\nplain\r\n     accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be,\r\n     though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.\r\n  Corn. What was th' offence you gave him?\r\n  Osw. I never gave him any.\r\n     It pleas'd the King his master very late\r\n     To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;\r\n     When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,\r\n     Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd\r\n     And put upon him such a deal of man\r\n     That worthied him, got praises of the King\r\n     For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;\r\n     And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,\r\n     Drew on me here again.\r\n  Kent. None of these rogues and cowards\r\n     But Ajax is their fool.\r\n  Corn. Fetch forth the stocks!\r\n     You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,\r\n     We'll teach you-\r\n  Kent. Sir, I am too old to learn.\r\n     Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;\r\n     On whose employment I was sent to you.\r\n     You shall do small respect, show too bold malice\r\n     Against the grace and person of my master,\r\n     Stocking his messenger.\r\n  Corn. Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,\r\n     There shall he sit till noon.\r\n  Reg. Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!\r\n  Kent. Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,\r\n     You should not use me so.\r\n  Reg. Sir, being his knave, I will.\r\n  Corn. This is a fellow of the selfsame colour\r\n     Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!\r\n                                             Stocks brought out.\r\n  Glou. Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.\r\n     His fault is much, and the good King his master\r\n     Will check him for't. Your purpos'd low correction\r\n     Is such as basest and contemn'dest wretches\r\n     For pilf'rings and most common trespasses\r\n     Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill\r\n     That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,\r\n     Should have him thus restrain'd.\r\n  Corn. I'll answer that.\r\n  Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse,\r\n     To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,\r\n     For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-\r\n                                    [Kent is put in the stocks.]\r\n     Come, my good lord, away.\r\n                           Exeunt [all but Gloucester and Kent].\r\n  Glou. I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure,\r\n     Whose disposition, all the world well knows,\r\n     Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd. I'll entreat for thee.\r\n  Kent. Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.\r\n     Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.\r\n     A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.\r\n     Give you good morrow!\r\n  Glou. The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.\r\nExit.\r\n  Kent. Good King, that must approve the common saw,\r\n     Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st\r\n     To the warm sun!\r\n     Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,\r\n     That by thy comfortable beams I may\r\n     Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles\r\n     But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,\r\n     Who hath most fortunately been inform'd\r\n     Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shall find time\r\n     From this enormous state, seeking to give\r\n     Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,\r\n     Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold\r\n     This shameful lodging.\r\n     Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.\r\n                                                         Sleeps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III.\r\nThe open country.\r\n\r\nEnter Edgar.\r\n\r\n  Edg. I heard myself proclaim'd,\r\n     And by the happy hollow of a tree\r\n     Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place\r\n     That guard and most unusual vigilance\r\n     Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape,\r\n     I will preserve myself; and am bethought\r\n     To take the basest and most poorest shape\r\n     That ever penury, in contempt of man,\r\n     Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,\r\n     Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,\r\n     And with presented nakedness outface\r\n     The winds and persecutions of the sky.\r\n     The country gives me proof and precedent\r\n     Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,\r\n     Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms\r\n     Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;\r\n     And with this horrible object, from low farms,\r\n     Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,\r\n     Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,\r\n     Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'\r\n     That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.             Exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV.\r\nBefore Gloucester's Castle; Kent in the stocks.\r\n\r\nEnter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman.\r\n\r\n  Lear. 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,\r\n     And not send back my messenger.\r\n  Gent. As I learn'd,\r\n     The night before there was no purpose in them\r\n     Of this remove.\r\n  Kent. Hail to thee, noble master!\r\n  Lear. Ha!\r\n     Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?\r\n  Kent. No, my lord.\r\n  Fool. Ha, ha! look! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by\r\nthe\r\n     head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and\r\nmen\r\n     by th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears\r\n     wooden nether-stocks.\r\n  Lear. What's he that hath so much thy place mistook\r\n     To set thee here?\r\n  Kent. It is both he and she-\r\n     Your son and daughter.\r\n  Lear. No.\r\n  Kent. Yes.\r\n  Lear. No, I say.\r\n  Kent. I say yea.\r\n  Lear. No, no, they would not!\r\n  Kent. Yes, they have.\r\n  Lear. By Jupiter, I swear no!\r\n  Kent. By Juno, I swear ay!\r\n  Lear. They durst not do't;\r\n     They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murther\r\n     To do upon respect such violent outrage.\r\n     Resolve me with all modest haste which way\r\n     Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,\r\n     Coming from us.\r\n  Kent. My lord, when at their home\r\n     I did commend your Highness' letters to them,\r\n     Ere I was risen from the place that show'd\r\n     My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,\r\n     Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth\r\n     From Goneril his mistress salutations;\r\n     Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,\r\n     Which presently they read; on whose contents,\r\n     They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse,\r\n     Commanded me to follow and attend\r\n     The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks,\r\n     And meeting here the other messenger,\r\n     Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine-\r\n     Being the very fellow which of late\r\n     Display'd so saucily against your Highness-\r\n     Having more man than wit about me, drew.\r\n     He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.\r\n     Your son and daughter found this trespass worth\r\n     The shame which here it suffers.\r\n  Fool. Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.\r\n\r\n          Fathers that wear rags\r\n            Do make their children blind;\r\n          But fathers that bear bags\r\n            Shall see their children kind.\r\n          Fortune, that arrant whore,\r\n          Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.\r\n\r\n     But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy\r\n     daughters as thou canst tell in a year.\r\n  Lear. O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!\r\n     Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow!\r\n     Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?\r\n  Kent. With the Earl, sir, here within.\r\n  Lear. Follow me not;\r\n     Stay here.                                            Exit.\r\n  Gent. Made you no more offence but what you speak of?\r\n  Kent. None.\r\n     How chance the King comes with so small a number?\r\n  Fool. An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question,\r\n     thou'dst well deserv'd it.\r\n  Kent. Why, fool?\r\n  Fool. We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's\r\nno\r\n     labouring i' th' winter. All that follow their noses are led\r\nby\r\n     their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among\r\ntwenty\r\n     but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a\r\ngreat\r\n     wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with\r\nfollowing\r\n     it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee\r\nafter.\r\n     When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine\r\nagain. I\r\n     would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.\r\n          That sir which serves and seeks for gain,\r\n            And follows but for form,\r\n          Will pack when it begins to rain\r\n            And leave thee in the storm.\r\n          But I will tarry; the fool will stay,\r\n            And let the wise man fly.\r\n          The knave turns fool that runs away;\r\n            The fool no knave, perdy.\r\n  Kent. Where learn'd you this, fool?\r\n  Fool. Not i' th' stocks, fool.\r\n\r\n                      Enter Lear and Gloucester\r\n\r\n  Lear. Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?\r\n     They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches-\r\n     The images of revolt and flying off!\r\n     Fetch me a better answer.\r\n  Glou. My dear lord,\r\n     You know the fiery quality of the Duke,\r\n     How unremovable and fix'd he is\r\n     In his own course.\r\n  Lear. Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!\r\n     Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,\r\n     I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.\r\n  Glou. Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.\r\n  Lear. Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?\r\n  Glou. Ay, my good lord.\r\n  Lear. The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father\r\n     Would with his daughter speak, commands her service.\r\n     Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!\r\n     Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that-\r\n     No, but not yet! May be he is not well.\r\n     Infirmity doth still neglect all office\r\n     Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves\r\n     When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind\r\n     To suffer with the body. I'll forbear;\r\n     And am fallen out with my more headier will,\r\n     To take the indispos'd and sickly fit\r\n     For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore\r\n     Should be sit here? This act persuades me\r\n     That this remotion of the Duke and her\r\n     Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.\r\n     Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-\r\n     Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,\r\n     Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum\r\n     Till it cry sleep to death.\r\n  Glou. I would have all well betwixt you.                 Exit.\r\n  Lear. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!\r\n  Fool. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when\r\nshe\r\n     put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs\r\nwith\r\n     a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother\r\nthat,\r\n     in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.\r\n\r\n             Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.\r\n\r\n  Lear. Good morrow to you both.\r\n  Corn. Hail to your Grace!\r\n                                       Kent here set at liberty.\r\n  Reg. I am glad to see your Highness.\r\n  Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason\r\n     I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,\r\n     I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,\r\n     Sepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free?\r\n     Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,\r\n     Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied\r\n     Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here!\r\n                                   [Lays his hand on his heart.]\r\n     I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe\r\n     With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!\r\n  Reg. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope\r\n     You less know how to value her desert\r\n     Than she to scant her duty.\r\n  Lear. Say, how is that?\r\n  Reg. I cannot think my sister in the least\r\n     Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance\r\n     She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,\r\n     'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,\r\n     As clears her from all blame.\r\n  Lear. My curses on her!\r\n  Reg. O, sir, you are old!\r\n     Nature in you stands on the very verge\r\n     Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led\r\n     By some discretion that discerns your state\r\n     Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you\r\n     That to our sister you do make return;\r\n     Say you have wrong'd her, sir.\r\n  Lear. Ask her forgiveness?\r\n     Do you but mark how this becomes the house:\r\n     'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.          [Kneels.]\r\n     Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg\r\n     That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'\r\n  Reg. Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.\r\n     Return you to my sister.\r\n  Lear. [rises] Never, Regan!\r\n     She hath abated me of half my train;\r\n     Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,\r\n     Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.\r\n     All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall\r\n     On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,\r\n     You taking airs, with lameness!\r\n  Corn. Fie, sir, fie!\r\n  Lear. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames\r\n     Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,\r\n     You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,\r\n     To fall and blast her pride!\r\n  Reg. O the blest gods! so will you wish on me\r\n     When the rash mood is on.\r\n  Lear. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.\r\n     Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give\r\n     Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine\r\n     Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee\r\n     To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,\r\n     To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,\r\n     And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt\r\n     Against my coming in. Thou better know'st\r\n     The offices of nature, bond of childhood,\r\n     Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.\r\n     Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,\r\n     Wherein I thee endow'd.\r\n  Reg. Good sir, to th' purpose.\r\n                                                  Tucket within.\r\n  Lear. Who put my man i' th' stocks?\r\n  Corn. What trumpet's that?\r\n  Reg. I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,\r\n     That she would soon be here.\r\n\r\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\r\n\r\n     Is your lady come?\r\n  Lear. This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride\r\n     Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.\r\n     Out, varlet, from my sight!\r\n  Corn. What means your Grace?\r\n\r\n                            Enter Goneril.\r\n\r\n  Lear. Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope\r\n     Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!\r\n     If you do love old men, if your sweet sway\r\n     Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,\r\n     Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!\r\n     [To Goneril] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?-\r\n     O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?\r\n  Gon. Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?\r\n     All's not offence that indiscretion finds\r\n     And dotage terms so.\r\n  Lear. O sides, you are too tough!\r\n     Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?\r\n  Corn. I set him there, sir; but his own disorders\r\n     Deserv'd much less advancement.\r\n  Lear. You? Did you?\r\n  Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.\r\n     If, till the expiration of your month,\r\n     You will return and sojourn with my sister,\r\n     Dismissing half your train, come then to me.\r\n     I am now from home, and out of that provision\r\n     Which shall be needful for your entertainment.\r\n  Lear. Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?\r\n     No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose\r\n     To wage against the enmity o' th' air,\r\n     To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-\r\n     Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?\r\n     Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took\r\n     Our youngest born, I could as well be brought\r\n     To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg\r\n     To keep base life afoot. Return with her?\r\n     Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter\r\n     To this detested groom.                 [Points at Oswald.]\r\n  Gon. At your choice, sir.\r\n  Lear. I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.\r\n     I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.\r\n     We'll no more meet, no more see one another.\r\n     But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;\r\n     Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,\r\n     Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,\r\n     A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle\r\n     In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.\r\n     Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.\r\n     I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot\r\n     Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.\r\n     Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;\r\n     I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,\r\n     I and my hundred knights.\r\n  Reg. Not altogether so.\r\n     I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided\r\n     For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;\r\n     For those that mingle reason with your passion\r\n     Must be content to think you old, and so-\r\n     But she knows what she does.\r\n  Lear. Is this well spoken?\r\n  Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?\r\n     Is it not well? What should you need of more?\r\n     Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger\r\n     Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house\r\n     Should many people, under two commands,\r\n     Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.\r\n  Gon. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance\r\n     From those that she calls servants, or from mine?\r\n  Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,\r\n     We could control them. If you will come to me\r\n     (For now I spy a danger), I entreat you\r\n     To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more\r\n     Will I give place or notice.\r\n  Lear. I gave you all-\r\n  Reg. And in good time you gave it!\r\n  Lear. Made you my guardians, my depositaries;\r\n     But kept a reservation to be followed\r\n     With such a number. What, must I come to you\r\n     With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?\r\n  Reg. And speak't again my lord. No more with me.\r\n  Lear. Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd\r\n     When others are more wicked; not being the worst\r\n     Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'll go with\r\nthee.\r\n     Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,\r\n     And thou art twice her love.\r\n  Gon. Hear, me, my lord.\r\n     What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,\r\n     To follow in a house where twice so many\r\n     Have a command to tend you?\r\n  Reg. What need one?\r\n  Lear. O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars\r\n     Are in the poorest thing superfluous.\r\n     Allow not nature more than nature needs,\r\n     Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:\r\n     If only to go warm were gorgeous,\r\n     Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st\r\n     Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-\r\n     You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!\r\n     You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,\r\n     As full of grief as age; wretched in both.\r\n     If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts\r\n     Against their father, fool me not so much\r\n     To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,\r\n     And let not women's weapons, water drops,\r\n     Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!\r\n     I will have such revenges on you both\r\n     That all the world shall- I will do such things-\r\n     What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be\r\n     The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.\r\n     No, I'll not weep.\r\n     I have full cause of weeping, but this heart\r\n     Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws\r\n     Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!\r\n              Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm and\r\n                                                        tempest.\r\n  Corn. Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.\r\n  Reg. This house is little; the old man and 's people\r\n     Cannot be well bestow'd.\r\n  Gon. 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest\r\n     And must needs taste his folly.\r\n  Reg. For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,\r\n     But not one follower.\r\n  Gon. So am I purpos'd.\r\n     Where is my Lord of Gloucester?\r\n  Corn. Followed the old man forth.\r\n\r\n                          Enter Gloucester.\r\n\r\n     He is return'd.\r\n  Glou. The King is in high rage.\r\n  Corn. Whither is he going?\r\n  Glou. He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.\r\n  Corn. 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.\r\n  Gon. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.\r\n  Glou. Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds\r\n     Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about\r\n     There's scarce a bush.\r\n  Reg. O, sir, to wilful men\r\n     The injuries that they themselves procure\r\n     Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.\r\n     He is attended with a desperate train,\r\n     And what they may incense him to, being apt\r\n     To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.\r\n  Corn. Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.\r\n     My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.\r\n[Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

Enter Kent and a Gentleman at several doors.\r\n\r\n  Kent. Who's there, besides foul weather?\r\n  Gent. One minded like the weather, most unquietly.\r\n  Kent. I know you. Where's the King?\r\n  Gent. Contending with the fretful elements;\r\n     Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,\r\n     Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,\r\n     That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,\r\n     Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,\r\n     Catch in their fury and make nothing of;\r\n     Strives in his little world of man to outscorn\r\n     The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.\r\n     This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,\r\n     The lion and the belly-pinched wolf\r\n     Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,\r\n     And bids what will take all.\r\n  Kent. But who is with him?\r\n  Gent. None but the fool, who labours to outjest\r\n     His heart-struck injuries.\r\n  Kent. Sir, I do know you,\r\n     And dare upon the warrant of my note\r\n     Commend a dear thing to you. There is division\r\n     (Although as yet the face of it be cover'd\r\n     With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;\r\n     Who have (as who have not, that their great stars\r\n     Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,\r\n     Which are to France the spies and speculations\r\n     Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,\r\n     Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,\r\n     Or the hard rein which both of them have borne\r\n     Against the old kind King, or something deeper,\r\n     Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings-\r\n     But, true it is, from France there comes a power\r\n     Into this scattered kingdom, who already,\r\n     Wise in our negligence, have secret feet\r\n     In some of our best ports and are at point\r\n     To show their open banner. Now to you:\r\n     If on my credit you dare build so far\r\n     To make your speed to Dover, you shall find\r\n     Some that will thank you, making just report\r\n     Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow\r\n     The King hath cause to plain.\r\n     I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,\r\n     And from some knowledge and assurance offer\r\n     This office to you.\r\n  Gent. I will talk further with you.\r\n  Kent. No, do not.\r\n     For confirmation that I am much more\r\n     Than my out-wall, open this purse and take\r\n     What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia\r\n     (As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,\r\n     And she will tell you who your fellow is\r\n     That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!\r\n     I will go seek the King.\r\n  Gent. Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?\r\n  Kent. Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:\r\n     That, when we have found the King (in which your pain\r\n     That way, I'll this), he that first lights on him\r\n     Holla the other.\r\n                                             Exeunt [severally].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II.\r\nAnother part of the heath.\r\n\r\nStorm still. Enter Lear and Fool.\r\n\r\n  Lear. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!\r\n     You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout\r\n     Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!\r\n     You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,\r\n     Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,\r\n     Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,\r\n     Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,\r\n     Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,\r\n     That makes ingrateful man!\r\n  Fool. O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than\r\nthis\r\n     rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy\r\ndaughters\r\n     blessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools.\r\n  Lear. Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!\r\n     Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.\r\n     I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.\r\n     I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,\r\n     You owe me no subscription. Then let fall\r\n     Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,\r\n     A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.\r\n     But yet I call you servile ministers,\r\n     That will with two pernicious daughters join\r\n     Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head\r\n     So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!\r\n  Fool. He that has a house to put 's head in has a good\r\nhead-piece.\r\n          The codpiece that will house\r\n            Before the head has any,\r\n          The head and he shall louse:\r\n            So beggars marry many.\r\n          The man that makes his toe\r\n            What he his heart should make\r\n          Shall of a corn cry woe,\r\n            And turn his sleep to wake.\r\n     For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a\r\n     glass.\r\n\r\n                             Enter Kent.\r\n\r\n  Lear. No, I will be the pattern of all patience;\r\n     I will say nothing.\r\n  Kent. Who's there?\r\n  Fool. Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and\r\na\r\n     fool.\r\n  Kent. Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night\r\n     Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies\r\n     Gallow the very wanderers of the dark\r\n     And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,\r\n     Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,\r\n     Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never\r\n     Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry\r\n     Th' affliction nor the fear.\r\n  Lear. Let the great gods,\r\n     That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,\r\n     Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,\r\n     That hast within thee undivulged crimes\r\n     Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;\r\n     Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue\r\n     That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake\r\n     That under covert and convenient seeming\r\n     Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,\r\n     Rive your concealing continents, and cry\r\n     These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man\r\n     More sinn'd against than sinning.\r\n  Kent. Alack, bareheaded?\r\n     Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;\r\n     Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.\r\n     Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house\r\n     (More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd,\r\n     Which even but now, demanding after you,\r\n     Denied me to come in) return, and force\r\n     Their scanted courtesy.\r\n  Lear. My wits begin to turn.\r\n     Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?\r\n     I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?\r\n     The art of our necessities is strange,\r\n     That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.\r\n     Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart\r\n     That's sorry yet for thee.\r\n  Fool. [sings]\r\n\r\n          He that has and a little tiny wit-\r\n            With hey, ho, the wind and the rain-\r\n          Must make content with his fortunes fit,\r\n             For the rain it raineth every day.\r\n\r\n  Lear. True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.\r\n                                         Exeunt [Lear and Kent].\r\n  Fool. This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a\r\n     prophecy ere I go:\r\n          When priests are more in word than matter;\r\n          When brewers mar their malt with water;\r\n          When nobles are their tailors' tutors,\r\n          No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;\r\n          When every case in law is right,\r\n          No squire in debt nor no poor knight;\r\n          When slanders do not live in tongues,\r\n          Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;\r\n          When usurers tell their gold i' th' field,\r\n          And bawds and whores do churches build:\r\n          Then shall the realm of Albion\r\n          Come to great confusion.\r\n          Then comes the time, who lives to see't,\r\n          That going shall be us'd with feet.\r\n     This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.\r\nExit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III.\r\nGloucester's Castle.\r\n\r\nEnter Gloucester and Edmund.\r\n\r\n  Glou. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing!\r\nWhen\r\n     I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from\r\nme\r\n     the use of mine own house, charg'd me on pain of perpetual\r\n     displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor\r\nany\r\n     way sustain him.\r\n  Edm. Most savage and unnatural!\r\n  Glou. Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the\r\nDukes,\r\n     and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this\r\n     night- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the letter\r\nin\r\n     my closet. These injuries the King now bears will be\r\nrevenged\r\n     home; there's part of a power already footed; we must\r\nincline to\r\n     the King. I will seek him and privily relieve him. Go you\r\nand\r\n     maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him\r\n     perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed.\r\nThough I\r\n     die for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old\r\nmaster\r\n     must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward,\r\nEdmund.\r\n     Pray you be careful.                                  Exit.\r\n  Edm. This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke\r\n     Instantly know, and of that letter too.\r\n     This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me\r\n     That which my father loses- no less than all.\r\n     The younger rises when the old doth fall.             Exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV.\r\nThe heath. Before a hovel.\r\n\r\nStorm still. Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.\r\n\r\n  Kent. Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.\r\n     The tyranny of the open night 's too rough\r\n     For nature to endure.\r\n  Lear. Let me alone.\r\n  Kent. Good my lord, enter here.\r\n  Lear. Wilt break my heart?\r\n  Kent. I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.\r\n  Lear. Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm\r\n     Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee;\r\n     But where the greater malady is fix'd,\r\n     The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;\r\n     But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,\r\n     Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,\r\n     The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind\r\n     Doth from my senses take all feeling else\r\n     Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!\r\n     Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand\r\n     For lifting food to't? But I will punish home!\r\n     No, I will weep no more. In such a night\r\n     'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.\r\n     In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!\r\n     Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!\r\n     O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!\r\n     No more of that.\r\n  Kent. Good my lord, enter here.\r\n  Lear. Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.\r\n     This tempest will not give me leave to ponder\r\n     On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.\r\n     [To the Fool] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty-\r\n     Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.\r\n                                                    Exit [Fool].\r\n     Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,\r\n     That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,\r\n     How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,\r\n     Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you\r\n     From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en\r\n     Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;\r\n     Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,\r\n     That thou mayst shake the superflux to them\r\n     And show the heavens more just.\r\n  Edg. [within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!\r\n\r\n                     Enter Fool [from the hovel].\r\n\r\n  Fool. Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help\r\nme!\r\n  Kent. Give me thy hand. Who's there?\r\n  Fool. A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom.\r\n  Kent. What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?\r\n     Come forth.\r\n\r\n                 Enter Edgar [disguised as a madman].\r\n\r\n  Edg. Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp\r\nhawthorn\r\n     blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm\r\nthee.\r\n  Lear. Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou\r\ncome\r\n     to this?\r\n  Edg. Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath\r\nled\r\n     through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool,\r\no'er\r\n     bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and\r\n     halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him\r\nproud\r\n     of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd\r\n     bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy\r\nfive\r\n     wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from\r\n     whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some\r\ncharity,\r\n     whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and\r\nthere-\r\n     and there again- and there!\r\n                                                    Storm still.\r\n  Lear. What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?\r\n     Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?\r\n  Fool. Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd.\r\n  Lear. Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air\r\n     Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!\r\n  Kent. He hath no daughters, sir.\r\n  Lear. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature\r\n     To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.\r\n     Is it the fashion that discarded fathers\r\n     Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?\r\n     Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot\r\n     Those pelican daughters.\r\n  Edg. Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo,\r\nloo!\r\n  Fool. This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.\r\n  Edg. Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy\r\nword\r\n     justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set\r\nnot\r\n     thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom 's acold.\r\n  Lear. What hast thou been?\r\n  Edg. A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my\r\nhair,\r\n     wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart\r\nand\r\n     did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I\r\nspake\r\n     words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that\r\n     slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine\r\nlov'd\r\n     I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk.\r\n     False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth,\r\nfox\r\n     in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in\r\nprey.\r\n     Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks\r\nbetray\r\n     thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy\r\nhand\r\n     out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the\r\nfoul\r\n     fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says\r\n     suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa!\r\nlet\r\n     him trot by.\r\n                                                    Storm still.\r\n  Lear. Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with\r\nthy\r\n     uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more\r\nthan\r\n     this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the\r\nbeast\r\n     no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's\r\nthree\r\n     on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself;\r\n     unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked\r\n     animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton\r\n     here.\r\n                                         [Tears at his clothes.]\r\n  Fool. Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to\r\nswim\r\n     in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old\r\nlecher's\r\n     heart- a small spark, all the rest on's body cold. Look,\r\nhere\r\n     comes a walking fire.\r\n\r\n                    Enter Gloucester with a torch.\r\n\r\n  Edg. This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at\r\ncurfew,\r\n     and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin,\r\n     squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white\r\nwheat,\r\n     and hurts the poor creature of earth.\r\n\r\n           Saint Withold footed thrice the 'old;\r\n           He met the nightmare, and her nine fold;\r\n              Bid her alight\r\n              And her troth plight,\r\n           And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!\r\n\r\n  Kent. How fares your Grace?\r\n  Lear. What's he?\r\n  Kent. Who's there? What is't you seek?\r\n  Glou. What are you there? Your names?\r\n  Edg. Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the\r\ntodpole,\r\n     the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart,\r\nwhen\r\n     the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows\r\nthe\r\n     old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the\r\n     standing pool; who is whipp'd from tithing to tithing, and\r\n     stock-punish'd and imprison'd; who hath had three suits to\r\nhis\r\n     back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to\r\n     wear;\r\n\r\n          But mice and rats, and such small deer,\r\n          Have been Tom's food for seven long year.\r\n\r\n     Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! peace, thou fiend!\r\n  Glou. What, hath your Grace no better company?\r\n  Edg. The prince of darkness is a gentleman!\r\n     Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.\r\n  Glou. Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,\r\n     That it doth hate what gets it.\r\n  Edg. Poor Tom 's acold.\r\n  Glou. Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer\r\n     T' obey in all your daughters' hard commands.\r\n     Though their injunction be to bar my doors\r\n     And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,\r\n     Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out\r\n     And bring you where both fire and food is ready.\r\n  Lear. First let me talk with this philosopher.\r\n     What is the cause of thunder?\r\n  Kent. Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house.\r\n  Lear. I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.\r\n     What is your study?\r\n  Edg. How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.\r\n  Lear. Let me ask you one word in private.\r\n  Kent. Importune him once more to go, my lord.\r\n     His wits begin t' unsettle.\r\n  Glou. Canst thou blame him?\r\n                                                    Storm still.\r\n     His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!\r\n     He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!\r\n     Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend,\r\n     I am almost mad myself. I had a son,\r\n     Now outlaw'd from my blood. He sought my life\r\n     But lately, very late. I lov'd him, friend-\r\n     No father his son dearer. True to tell thee,\r\n     The grief hath craz'd my wits. What a night 's this!\r\n     I do beseech your Grace-\r\n  Lear. O, cry you mercy, sir.\r\n     Noble philosopher, your company.\r\n  Edg. Tom's acold.\r\n  Glou. In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee warm.\r\n  Lear. Come, let's in all.\r\n  Kent. This way, my lord.\r\n  Lear. With him!\r\n     I will keep still with my philosopher.\r\n  Kent. Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.\r\n  Glou. Take him you on.\r\n  Kent. Sirrah, come on; go along with us.\r\n  Lear. Come, good Athenian.\r\n  Glou. No words, no words! hush.\r\n  Edg. Child Rowland to the dark tower came;\r\n     His word was still\r\n\r\n          Fie, foh, and fum!\r\n          I smell the blood of a British man.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\nScene V.\r\nGloucester's Castle.\r\n\r\nEnter Cornwall and Edmund.\r\n\r\n  Corn. I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.\r\n  Edm. How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives\r\nway to\r\n     loyalty, something fears me to think of.\r\n  Corn. I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil\r\n     disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit,\r\nset\r\n     awork by a reproveable badness in himself.\r\n  Edm. How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just!\r\n     This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an\r\n     intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens!\r\nthat\r\n     this treason were not- or not I the detector!\r\n  Corn. Go with me to the Duchess.\r\n  Edm. If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty\r\n     business in hand.\r\n  Corn. True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.\r\n     Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our\r\n     apprehension.\r\n  Edm. [aside] If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff\r\nhis\r\n     suspicion more fully.- I will persever in my course of\r\nloyalty,\r\n     though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.\r\n  Corn. I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer\r\n     father in my love.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene VI.\r\nA farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.\r\n\r\nEnter Gloucester, Lear, Kent, Fool, and Edgar.\r\n\r\n  Glou. Here is better than the open air; take it thankfully. I\r\nwill\r\n     piece out the comfort with what addition I can. I will not\r\nbe\r\n     long from you.\r\n  Kent. All the power of his wits have given way to his\r\nimpatience.\r\n     The gods reward your kindness!\r\n                                              Exit [Gloucester].\r\n  Edg. Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the\r\n     lake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.\r\n  Fool. Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman\r\nor a\r\n     yeoman.\r\n  Lear. A king, a king!\r\n  Fool. No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for\r\nhe's a\r\n     mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.\r\n  Lear. To have a thousand with red burning spits\r\n     Come hizzing in upon 'em-\r\n  Edg. The foul fiend bites my back.\r\n  Fool. He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's\r\n     health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.\r\n  Lear. It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.\r\n     [To Edgar] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.\r\n     [To the Fool] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you\r\nshe-foxes!\r\n  Edg. Look, where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at\r\ntrial,\r\n     madam?\r\n\r\n             Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me.\r\n\r\n  Fool.      Her boat hath a leak,\r\n             And she must not speak\r\n           Why she dares not come over to thee.\r\n\r\n  Edg. The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a\r\nnightingale.\r\n     Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring. Croak\r\n     not, black angel; I have no food for thee.\r\n  Kent. How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd.\r\n     Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?\r\n  Lear. I'll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence.\r\n     [To Edgar] Thou, robed man of justice, take thy place.\r\n     [To the Fool] And thou, his yokefellow of equity,\r\n     Bench by his side. [To Kent] You are o' th' commission,\r\n     Sit you too.\r\n  Edg. Let us deal justly.\r\n\r\n          Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?\r\n            Thy sheep be in the corn;\r\n          And for one blast of thy minikin mouth\r\n            Thy sheep shall take no harm.\r\n\r\n     Purr! the cat is gray.\r\n  Lear. Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath\r\nbefore\r\n     this honourable assembly, she kicked the poor King her\r\nfather.\r\n  Fool. Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?\r\n  Lear. She cannot deny it.\r\n  Fool. Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.\r\n  Lear. And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim\r\n     What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!\r\n     Arms, arms! sword! fire! Corruption in the place!\r\n     False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?\r\n  Edg. Bless thy five wits!\r\n  Kent. O pity! Sir, where is the patience now\r\n     That you so oft have boasted to retain?\r\n  Edg. [aside] My tears begin to take his part so much\r\n     They'll mar my counterfeiting.\r\n  Lear. The little dogs and all,\r\n     Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.\r\n  Edg. Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!\r\n           Be thy mouth or black or white,\r\n           Tooth that poisons if it bite;\r\n           Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,\r\n           Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,\r\n           Bobtail tyke or trundle-tall-\r\n           Tom will make them weep and wail;\r\n           For, with throwing thus my head,\r\n           Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.\r\n     Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and\r\nmarket\r\n     towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.\r\n  Lear. Then let them anatomize Regan. See what breeds about her\r\n     heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard\r\n     hearts? [To Edgar] You, sir- I entertain you for one of my\r\n     hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments.\r\nYou'll\r\n     say they are Persian attire; but let them be chang'd.\r\n  Kent. Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.\r\n  Lear. Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.\r\n     So, so, so. We'll go to supper i' th' morning. So, so, so.\r\n  Fool. And I'll go to bed at noon.\r\n\r\n                          Enter Gloucester.\r\n\r\n  Glou. Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master?\r\n  Kent. Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone.\r\n  Glou. Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms.\r\n     I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him.\r\n     There is a litter ready; lay him in't\r\n     And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet\r\n     Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master.\r\n     If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,\r\n     With thine, and all that offer to defend him,\r\n     Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up!\r\n     And follow me, that will to some provision\r\n     Give thee quick conduct.\r\n  Kent. Oppressed nature sleeps.\r\n     This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,\r\n     Which, if convenience will not allow,\r\n     Stand in hard cure. [To the Fool] Come, help to bear thy\r\nmaster.\r\n     Thou must not stay behind.\r\n  Glou. Come, come, away!\r\n                                         Exeunt [all but Edgar].\r\n  Edg. When we our betters see bearing our woes,\r\n     We scarcely think our miseries our foes.\r\n     Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind,\r\n     Leaving free things and happy shows behind;\r\n     But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip\r\n     When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.\r\n     How light and portable my pain seems now,\r\n     When that which makes me bend makes the King bow,\r\n     He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!\r\n     Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray\r\n     When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,\r\n     In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.\r\n     What will hap more to-night, safe scape the King!\r\n     Lurk, lurk.                                         [Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene VII.\r\nGloucester's Castle.\r\n\r\nEnter Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, [Edmund the] Bastard, and\r\nServants.\r\n\r\n  Corn. [to Goneril] Post speedily to my lord your husband, show\r\nhim\r\n     this letter. The army of France is landed.- Seek out the\r\ntraitor\r\n     Gloucester.\r\n                                  [Exeunt some of the Servants.]\r\n  Reg. Hang him instantly.\r\n  Gon. Pluck out his eyes.\r\n  Corn. Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our sister\r\n     company. The revenges we are bound to take upon your\r\ntraitorous\r\n     father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke where\r\nyou\r\n     are going, to a most festinate preparation. We are bound to\r\nthe\r\n     like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.\r\n     Farewell, dear sister; farewell, my Lord of Gloucester.\r\n\r\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\r\n\r\n     How now? Where's the King?\r\n  Osw. My Lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence.\r\n     Some five or six and thirty of his knights,\r\n     Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;\r\n     Who, with some other of the lord's dependants,\r\n     Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast\r\n     To have well-armed friends.\r\n  Corn. Get horses for your mistress.\r\n  Gon. Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.\r\n  Corn. Edmund, farewell.\r\n                           Exeunt Goneril, [Edmund, and Oswald].\r\n     Go seek the traitor Gloucester,\r\n     Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.\r\n                                        [Exeunt other Servants.]\r\n     Though well we may not pass upon his life\r\n     Without the form of justice, yet our power\r\n     Shall do a court'sy to our wrath, which men\r\n     May blame, but not control.\r\n\r\n            Enter Gloucester, brought in by two or three.\r\n\r\n     Who's there? the traitor?\r\n  Reg. Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.\r\n  Corn. Bind fast his corky arms.\r\n  Glou. What mean, your Graces? Good my friends, consider\r\n     You are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.\r\n  Corn. Bind him, I say.\r\n                                            [Servants bind him.]\r\n  Reg. Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!\r\n  Glou. Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none.\r\n  Corn. To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find-\r\n                                       [Regan plucks his beard.]\r\n  Glou. By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done\r\n     To pluck me by the beard.\r\n  Reg. So white, and such a traitor!\r\n  Glou. Naughty lady,\r\n     These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin\r\n     Will quicken, and accuse thee. I am your host.\r\n     With robber's hands my hospitable favours\r\n     You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?\r\n  Corn. Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?\r\n  Reg. Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.\r\n  Corn. And what confederacy have you with the traitors\r\n     Late footed in the kingdom?\r\n  Reg. To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?\r\n     Speak.\r\n  Glou. I have a letter guessingly set down,\r\n     Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,\r\n     And not from one oppos'd.\r\n  Corn. Cunning.\r\n  Reg. And false.\r\n  Corn. Where hast thou sent the King?\r\n  Glou. To Dover.\r\n  Reg. Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-\r\n  Corn. Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.\r\n  Glou. I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.\r\n  Reg. Wherefore to Dover, sir?\r\n  Glou. Because I would not see thy cruel nails\r\n     Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister\r\n     In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.\r\n     The sea, with such a storm as his bare head\r\n     In hell-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd up\r\n     And quench'd the steeled fires.\r\n     Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.\r\n     If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,\r\n     Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.'\r\n     All cruels else subscrib'd. But I shall see\r\n     The winged vengeance overtake such children.\r\n  Corn. See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.\r\n     Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.\r\n  Glou. He that will think to live till he be old,\r\n     Give me some help!- O cruel! O ye gods!\r\n  Reg. One side will mock another. Th' other too!\r\n  Corn. If you see vengeance-\r\n  1. Serv. Hold your hand, my lord!\r\n     I have serv'd you ever since I was a child;\r\n     But better service have I never done you\r\n     Than now to bid you hold.\r\n  Reg. How now, you dog?\r\n  1. Serv. If you did wear a beard upon your chin,\r\n     I'ld shake it on this quarrel.\r\n  Reg. What do you mean?\r\n  Corn. My villain!                               Draw and fight.\r\n  1. Serv. Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.\r\n  Reg. Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?\r\n                        She takes a sword and runs at him behind.\r\n  1. Serv. O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left\r\n     To see some mischief on him. O!                     He dies.\r\n  Corn. Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!\r\n     Where is thy lustre now?\r\n  Glou. All dark and comfortless! Where's my son Edmund?\r\n     Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature\r\n     To quit this horrid act.\r\n  Reg. Out, treacherous villain!\r\n     Thou call'st on him that hates thee. It was he\r\n     That made the overture of thy treasons to us;\r\n     Who is too good to pity thee.\r\n  Glou. O my follies! Then Edgar was abus'd.\r\n     Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!\r\n  Reg. Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell\r\n     His way to Dover.\r\n                                     Exit [one] with Gloucester.\r\n     How is't, my lord? How look you?\r\n  Corn. I have receiv'd a hurt. Follow me, lady.\r\n     Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave\r\n     Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace.\r\n     Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.\r\n                                  Exit [Cornwall, led by Regan].\r\n  2. Serv. I'll never care what wickedness I do,\r\n     If this man come to good.\r\n  3. Serv. If she live long,\r\n     And in the end meet the old course of death,\r\n     Women will all turn monsters.\r\n  2. Serv. Let's follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam\r\n     To lead him where he would. His roguish madness\r\n     Allows itself to anything.\r\n  3. Serv. Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs\r\n     To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,\r\n     Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,\r\n     The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,\r\n     Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.\r\n     The lamentable change is from the best;\r\n     The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,\r\n     Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!\r\n     The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst\r\n     Owes nothing to thy blasts.\r\n\r\n                 Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man.\r\n\r\n     But who comes here?\r\n     My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!\r\n     But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,\r\n     Life would not yield to age.\r\n  Old Man. O my good lord,\r\n     I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,\r\n     These fourscore years.\r\n  Glou. Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone.\r\n     Thy comforts can do me no good at all;\r\n     Thee they may hurt.\r\n  Old Man. You cannot see your way.\r\n  Glou. I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;\r\n     I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen\r\n     Our means secure us, and our mere defects\r\n     Prove our commodities. Ah dear son Edgar,\r\n     The food of thy abused father's wrath!\r\n     Might I but live to see thee in my touch,\r\n     I'ld say I had eyes again!\r\n  Old Man. How now? Who's there?\r\n  Edg. [aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?\r\n     I am worse than e'er I was.\r\n  Old Man. 'Tis poor mad Tom.\r\n  Edg. [aside] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not\r\n     So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'\r\n  Old Man. Fellow, where goest?\r\n  Glou. Is it a beggarman?\r\n  Old Man. Madman and beggar too.\r\n  Glou. He has some reason, else he could not beg.\r\n     I' th' last night's storm I such a fellow saw,\r\n     Which made me think a man a worm. My son\r\n     Came then into my mind, and yet my mind\r\n     Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since.\r\n     As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods.\r\n     They kill us for their sport.\r\n  Edg. [aside] How should this be?\r\n     Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,\r\n     Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master!\r\n  Glou. Is that the naked fellow?\r\n  Old Man. Ay, my lord.\r\n  Glou. Then prithee get thee gone. If for my sake\r\n     Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain\r\n     I' th' way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;\r\n     And bring some covering for this naked soul,\r\n     Who I'll entreat to lead me.\r\n  Old Man. Alack, sir, he is mad!\r\n  Glou. 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.\r\n     Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.\r\n     Above the rest, be gone.\r\n  Old Man. I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,\r\n     Come on't what will.                                  Exit.\r\n  Glou. Sirrah naked fellow-\r\n  Edg. Poor Tom's acold. [Aside] I cannot daub it further.\r\n  Glou. Come hither, fellow.\r\n  Edg. [aside] And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.\r\n  Glou. Know'st thou the way to Dover?\r\n  Edg. Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath\r\nbeen\r\n     scar'd out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man's son,\r\nfrom\r\n     the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once:\r\nof\r\n     lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu,\r\nof\r\n     stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and\r\n     mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women.\r\nSo,\r\n     bless thee, master!\r\n  Glou. Here, take this Purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues\r\n     Have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched\r\n     Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still!\r\n     Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,\r\n     That slaves your ordinance, that will not see\r\n     Because he does not feel, feel your pow'r quickly;\r\n     So distribution should undo excess,\r\n     And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?\r\n  Edg. Ay, master.\r\n  Glou. There is a cliff, whose high and bending head\r\n     Looks fearfully in the confined deep.\r\n     Bring me but to the very brim of it,\r\n     And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear\r\n     With something rich about me. From that place\r\n     I shall no leading need.\r\n  Edg. Give me thy arm.\r\n     Poor Tom shall lead thee.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II.\r\nBefore the Duke of Albany's Palace.\r\n\r\nEnter Goneril and [Edmund the] Bastard.\r\n\r\n  Gon. Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband\r\n     Not met us on the way.\r\n\r\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\r\n\r\n     Now, where's your master?\r\n  Osw. Madam, within, but never man so chang'd.\r\n     I told him of the army that was landed:\r\n     He smil'd at it. I told him you were coming:\r\n     His answer was, 'The worse.' Of Gloucester's treachery\r\n     And of the loyal service of his son\r\n     When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot\r\n     And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out.\r\n     What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;\r\n     What like, offensive.\r\n  Gon. [to Edmund] Then shall you go no further.\r\n     It is the cowish terror of his spirit,\r\n     That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs\r\n     Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way\r\n     May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.\r\n     Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs.\r\n     I must change arms at home and give the distaff\r\n     Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant\r\n     Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear\r\n     (If you dare venture in your own behalf)\r\n     A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]\r\n     Spare speech.\r\n     Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,\r\n     Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.\r\n     Conceive, and fare thee well.\r\n  Edm. Yours in the ranks of death!                        Exit.\r\n  Gon. My most dear Gloucester!\r\n     O, the difference of man and man!\r\n     To thee a woman's services are due;\r\n     My fool usurps my body.\r\n  Osw. Madam, here comes my lord.                          Exit.\r\n\r\n                            Enter Albany.\r\n\r\n  Gon. I have been worth the whistle.\r\n  Alb. O Goneril,\r\n     You are not worth the dust which the rude wind\r\n     Blows in your face! I fear your disposition.\r\n     That nature which contemns it origin\r\n     Cannot be bordered certain in itself.\r\n     She that herself will sliver and disbranch\r\n     From her material sap, perforce must wither\r\n     And come to deadly use.\r\n  Gon. No more! The text is foolish.\r\n  Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;\r\n     Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?\r\n     Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?\r\n     A father, and a gracious aged man,\r\n     Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,\r\n     Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.\r\n     Could my good brother suffer you to do it?\r\n     A man, a prince, by him so benefited!\r\n     If that the heavens do not their visible spirits\r\n     Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,\r\n     It will come,\r\n     Humanity must perforce prey on itself,\r\n     Like monsters of the deep.\r\n  Gon. Milk-liver'd man!\r\n     That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;\r\n     Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning\r\n     Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st\r\n     Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd\r\n     Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?\r\n     France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,\r\n     With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,\r\n     Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest\r\n     'Alack, why does he so?'\r\n  Alb. See thyself, devil!\r\n     Proper deformity seems not in the fiend\r\n     So horrid as in woman.\r\n  Gon. O vain fool!\r\n  Alb. Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!\r\n     Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitness\r\n     To let these hands obey my blood,\r\n     They are apt enough to dislocate and tear\r\n     Thy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend,\r\n     A woman's shape doth shield thee.\r\n  Gon. Marry, your manhood mew!\r\n\r\n                          Enter a Gentleman.\r\n\r\n  Alb. What news?\r\n  Gent. O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall 's dead,\r\n     Slain by his servant, going to put out\r\n     The other eye of Gloucester.\r\n  Alb. Gloucester's eyes?\r\n  Gent. A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,\r\n     Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword\r\n     To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,\r\n     Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;\r\n     But not without that harmful stroke which since\r\n     Hath pluck'd him after.\r\n  Alb. This shows you are above,\r\n     You justicers, that these our nether crimes\r\n     So speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester!\r\n     Lose he his other eye?\r\n  Gent. Both, both, my lord.\r\n     This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.\r\n     'Tis from your sister.\r\n  Gon. [aside] One way I like this well;\r\n     But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,\r\n     May all the building in my fancy pluck\r\n     Upon my hateful life. Another way\r\n     The news is not so tart.- I'll read, and answer.\r\nExit.\r\n  Alb. Where was his son when they did take his eyes?\r\n  Gent. Come with my lady hither.\r\n  Alb. He is not here.\r\n  Gent. No, my good lord; I met him back again.\r\n  Alb. Knows he the wickedness?\r\n  Gent. Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him,\r\n     And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment\r\n     Might have the freer course.\r\n  Alb. Gloucester, I live\r\n     To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King,\r\n     And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend.\r\n     Tell me what more thou know'st.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III.\r\nThe French camp near Dover.\r\n\r\nEnter Kent and a Gentleman.\r\n\r\n  Kent. Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you\r\nthe\r\n     reason?\r\n  Gent. Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his\r\n     coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so\r\nmuch\r\n     fear and danger that his personal return was most required\r\nand\r\n     necessary.\r\n  Kent. Who hath he left behind him general?\r\n  Gent. The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.\r\n  Kent. Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of\r\n     grief?\r\n  Gent. Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,\r\n     And now and then an ample tear trill'd down\r\n     Her delicate cheek. It seem'd she was a queen\r\n     Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,\r\n     Sought to be king o'er her.\r\n  Kent. O, then it mov'd her?\r\n  Gent. Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove\r\n     Who should express her goodliest. You have seen\r\n     Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears\r\n     Were like, a better way. Those happy smilets\r\n     That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know\r\n     What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence\r\n     As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,\r\n     Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,\r\n     If all could so become it.\r\n  Kent. Made she no verbal question?\r\n  Gent. Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father\r\n     Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;\r\n     Cried 'Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters!\r\n     Kent! father! sisters! What, i' th' storm? i' th' night?\r\n     Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook\r\n     The holy water from her heavenly eyes,\r\n     And clamour moisten'd. Then away she started\r\n     To deal with grief alone.\r\n  Kent. It is the stars,\r\n     The stars above us, govern our conditions;\r\n     Else one self mate and mate could not beget\r\n     Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?\r\n  Gent. No.\r\n  Kent. Was this before the King return'd?\r\n  Gent. No, since.\r\n  Kent. Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town;\r\n     Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers\r\n     What we are come about, and by no means\r\n     Will yield to see his daughter.\r\n  Gent. Why, good sir?\r\n  Kent. A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness,\r\n     That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her\r\n     To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights\r\n     To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting\r\n     His mind so venomously that burning shame\r\n     Detains him from Cordelia.\r\n  Gent. Alack, poor gentleman!\r\n  Kent. Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?\r\n  Gent. 'Tis so; they are afoot.\r\n  Kent. Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear\r\n     And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause\r\n     Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.\r\n     When I am known aright, you shall not grieve\r\n     Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go\r\n     Along with me.                                      Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV.\r\nThe French camp.\r\n\r\nEnter, with Drum and Colours, Cordelia, Doctor, and Soldiers.\r\n\r\n  Cor. Alack, 'tis he! Why, he was met even now\r\n     As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud,\r\n     Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,\r\n     With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flow'rs,\r\n     Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow\r\n     In our sustaining corn. A century send forth.\r\n     Search every acre in the high-grown field\r\n     And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Officer.] What can man's\r\n        wisdom\r\n     In the restoring his bereaved sense?\r\n     He that helps him take all my outward worth.\r\n  Doct. There is means, madam.\r\n     Our foster nurse of nature is repose,\r\n     The which he lacks. That to provoke in him\r\n     Are many simples operative, whose power\r\n     Will close the eye of anguish.\r\n  Cor. All blest secrets,\r\n     All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,\r\n     Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate\r\n     In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him!\r\n     Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life\r\n     That wants the means to lead it.\r\n\r\n                           Enter Messenger.\r\n\r\n  Mess. News, madam.\r\n     The British pow'rs are marching hitherward.\r\n  Cor. 'Tis known before. Our preparation stands\r\n     In expectation of them. O dear father,\r\n     It is thy business that I go about.\r\n     Therefore great France\r\n     My mourning and important tears hath pitied.\r\n     No blown ambition doth our arms incite,\r\n     But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right.\r\n     Soon may I hear and see him!\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene V.\r\nGloucester's Castle.\r\n\r\nEnter Regan and [Oswald the] Steward.\r\n\r\n  Reg. But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?\r\n  Osw. Ay, madam.\r\n  Reg. Himself in person there?\r\n  Osw. Madam, with much ado.\r\n     Your sister is the better soldier.\r\n  Reg. Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?\r\n  Osw. No, madam.\r\n  Reg. What might import my sister's letter to him?\r\n  Osw. I know not, lady.\r\n  Reg. Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.\r\n     It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,\r\n     To let him live. Where he arrives he moves\r\n     All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,\r\n     In pity of his misery, to dispatch\r\n     His nighted life; moreover, to descry\r\n     The strength o' th' enemy.\r\n  Osw. I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.\r\n  Reg. Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.\r\n     The ways are dangerous.\r\n  Osw. I may not, madam.\r\n     My lady charg'd my duty in this business.\r\n  Reg. Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you\r\n     Transport her purposes by word? Belike,\r\n     Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-\r\n     Let me unseal the letter.\r\n  Osw. Madam, I had rather-\r\n  Reg. I know your lady does not love her husband;\r\n     I am sure of that; and at her late being here\r\n     She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks\r\n     To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.\r\n  Osw. I, madam?\r\n  Reg. I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.\r\n     Therefore I do advise you take this note.\r\n     My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,\r\n     And more convenient is he for my hand\r\n     Than for your lady's. You may gather more.\r\n     If you do find him, pray you give him this;\r\n     And when your mistress hears thus much from you,\r\n     I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.\r\n     So farewell.\r\n     If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\r\n     Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.\r\n  Osw. Would I could meet him, madam! I should show\r\n     What party I do follow.\r\n  Reg. Fare thee well.                                   Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene VI.\r\nThe country near Dover.\r\n\r\nEnter Gloucester, and Edgar [like a Peasant].\r\n\r\n  Glou. When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?\r\n  Edg. You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.\r\n  Glou. Methinks the ground is even.\r\n  Edg. Horrible steep.\r\n     Hark, do you hear the sea?\r\n  Glou. No, truly.\r\n  Edg. Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect\r\n     By your eyes' anguish.\r\n  Glou. So may it be indeed.\r\n     Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st\r\n     In better phrase and matter than thou didst.\r\n  Edg. Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd\r\n     But in my garments.\r\n  Glou. Methinks y'are better spoken.\r\n  Edg. Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearful\r\n     And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!\r\n     The crows and choughs that wing the midway air\r\n     Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down\r\n     Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!\r\n     Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.\r\n     The fishermen that walk upon the beach\r\n     Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,\r\n     Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy\r\n     Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge\r\n     That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes\r\n     Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,\r\n     Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\r\n     Topple down headlong.\r\n  Glou. Set me where you stand.\r\n  Edg. Give me your hand. You are now within a foot\r\n     Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon\r\n     Would I not leap upright.\r\n  Glou. Let go my hand.\r\n     Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel\r\n     Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods\r\n     Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;\r\n     Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.\r\n  Edg. Now fare ye well, good sir.\r\n  Glou. With all my heart.\r\n  Edg. [aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despair\r\n     Is done to cure it.\r\n  Glou. O you mighty gods!                            He kneels.\r\n     This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,\r\n     Shake patiently my great affliction off.\r\n     If I could bear it longer and not fall\r\n     To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,\r\n     My snuff and loathed part of nature should\r\n     Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!\r\n     Now, fellow, fare thee well.\r\n                                  He falls [forward and swoons].\r\n  Edg. Gone, sir, farewell.-\r\n     And yet I know not how conceit may rob\r\n     The treasury of life when life itself\r\n     Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,\r\n     By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead?\r\n     Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!-\r\n     Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.\r\n     What are you, sir?\r\n  Glou. Away, and let me die.\r\n  Edg. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\r\n     So many fadom down precipitating,\r\n     Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;\r\n     Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.\r\n     Ten masts at each make not the altitude\r\n     Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.\r\n     Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.\r\n  Glou. But have I fall'n, or no?\r\n  Edg. From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\r\n     Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far\r\n     Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.\r\n  Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!\r\n     Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit\r\n     To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort\r\n     When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage\r\n     And frustrate his proud will.\r\n  Edg. Give me your arm.\r\n     Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.\r\n  Glou. Too well, too well.\r\n  Edg. This is above all strangeness.\r\n     Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that\r\n     Which parted from you?\r\n  Glou. A poor unfortunate beggar.\r\n  Edg. As I stood here below, methought his eyes\r\n     Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\r\n     Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea.\r\n     It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,\r\n     Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours\r\n     Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee.\r\n  Glou. I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear\r\n     Affliction till it do cry out itself\r\n     'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,\r\n     I took it for a man. Often 'twould say\r\n     'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.\r\n  Edg. Bear free and patient thoughts.\r\n\r\n         Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds].\r\n\r\n     But who comes here?\r\n     The safer sense will ne'er accommodate\r\n     His master thus.\r\n  Lear. No, they cannot touch me for coming;\r\n     I am the King himself.\r\n  Edg. O thou side-piercing sight!\r\n  Lear. Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press\r\n     money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw\r\nme\r\n     a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this\r\npiece\r\n     of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove\r\nit\r\n     on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!\r\ni'\r\n     th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.\r\n  Edg. Sweet marjoram.\r\n  Lear. Pass.\r\n  Glou. I know that voice.\r\n  Lear. Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a\r\ndog,\r\n     and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones\r\n     were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay'\r\nand\r\n     'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me\r\n     once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder\r\nwould\r\n     not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt\r\n'em\r\n     out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I\r\nwas\r\n     everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof.\r\n  Glou. The trick of that voice I do well remember.\r\n     Is't not the King?\r\n  Lear. Ay, every inch a king!\r\n     When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\r\n     I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?\r\n     Adultery?\r\n     Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.\r\n     The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly\r\n     Does lecher in my sight.\r\n     Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son\r\n     Was kinder to his father than my daughters\r\n     Got 'tween the lawful sheets.\r\n     To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.\r\n     Behold yond simp'ring dame,\r\n     Whose face between her forks presageth snow,\r\n     That minces virtue, and does shake the head\r\n     To hear of pleasure's name.\r\n     The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't\r\n     With a more riotous appetite.\r\n     Down from the waist they are Centaurs,\r\n     Though women all above.\r\n     But to the girdle do the gods inherit,\r\n     Beneath is all the fiend's.\r\n     There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;\r\n     burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah,\r\npah!\r\n     Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my\r\n     imagination. There's money for thee.\r\n  Glou. O, let me kiss that hand!\r\n  Lear. Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\r\n  Glou. O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world\r\n     Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?\r\n  Lear. I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at\r\nme?\r\n     No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this\r\n     challenge; mark but the penning of it.\r\n  Glou. Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.\r\n  Edg. [aside] I would not take this from report. It is,\r\n     And my heart breaks at it.\r\n  Lear. Read.\r\n  Glou. What, with the case of eyes?\r\n  Lear. O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor\r\nno\r\n     money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your\r\npurse\r\n     in a light. Yet you see how this world goes.\r\n  Glou. I see it feelingly.\r\n  Lear. What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no\r\neyes.\r\n     Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond\r\n     simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and,\r\nhandy-dandy,\r\n     which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a\r\n     farmer's dog bark at a beggar?\r\n  Glou. Ay, sir.\r\n  Lear. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst\r\nbehold\r\n     the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.\r\n     Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\r\n     Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.\r\n     Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind\r\n     For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.\r\n     Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;\r\n     Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,\r\n     And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;\r\n     Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.\r\n     None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.\r\n     Take that of me, my friend, who have the power\r\n     To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes\r\n     And, like a scurvy politician, seem\r\n     To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!\r\n     Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So.\r\n  Edg. O, matter and impertinency mix'd!\r\n     Reason, in madness!\r\n  Lear. If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.\r\n     I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.\r\n     Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;\r\n     Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air\r\n     We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.\r\n  Glou. Alack, alack the day!\r\n  Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are come\r\n     To this great stage of fools. This' a good block.\r\n     It were a delicate stratagem to shoe\r\n     A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,\r\n     And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,\r\n     Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\r\n\r\n                 Enter a Gentleman [with Attendants].\r\n\r\n  Gent. O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,\r\n     Your most dear daughter-\r\n  Lear. No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even\r\n     The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;\r\n     You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;\r\n     I am cut to th' brains.\r\n  Gent. You shall have anything.\r\n  Lear. No seconds? All myself?\r\n     Why, this would make a man a man of salt,\r\n     To use his eyes for garden waterpots,\r\n     Ay, and laying autumn's dust.\r\n  Gent. Good sir-\r\n  Lear. I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!\r\n     I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king;\r\n     My masters, know you that?\r\n  Gent. You are a royal one, and we obey you.\r\n  Lear. Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get\r\nit\r\n     by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!\r\n                              Exit running. [Attendants follow.]\r\n  Gent. A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,\r\n     Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter\r\n     Who redeems nature from the general curse\r\n     Which twain have brought her to.\r\n  Edg. Hail, gentle sir.\r\n  Gent. Sir, speed you. What's your will?\r\n  Edg. Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?\r\n  Gent. Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that\r\n     Which can distinguish sound.\r\n  Edg. But, by your favour,\r\n     How near's the other army?\r\n  Gent. Near and on speedy foot. The main descry\r\n     Stands on the hourly thought.\r\n  Edg. I thank you sir. That's all.\r\n  Gent. Though that the Queen on special cause is here,\r\n     Her army is mov'd on.\r\n  Edg. I thank you, sir\r\n                                               Exit [Gentleman].\r\n  Glou. You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;\r\n     Let not my worser spirit tempt me again\r\n     To die before you please!\r\n  Edg. Well pray you, father.\r\n  Glou. Now, good sir, what are you?\r\n  Edg. A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,\r\n     Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,\r\n     Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;\r\n     I'll lead you to some biding.\r\n  Glou. Hearty thanks.\r\n     The bounty and the benison of heaven\r\n     To boot, and boot!\r\n\r\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\r\n\r\n  Osw. A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!\r\n     That eyeless head of thine was first fram'd flesh\r\n     To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,\r\n     Briefly thyself remember. The sword is out\r\n     That must destroy thee.\r\n  Glou. Now let thy friendly hand\r\n     Put strength enough to't.\r\n                                             [Edgar interposes.]\r\n  Osw. Wherefore, bold peasant,\r\n     Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!\r\n     Lest that th' infection of his fortune take\r\n     Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.\r\n  Edg. Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion.\r\n  Osw. Let go, slave, or thou diest!\r\n  Edg. Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. An\r\nchud\r\n     ha' bin zwagger'd out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo\r\nlong as\r\n     'tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th' old man. Keep\r\nout,\r\n     che vore ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my ballow be\r\nthe\r\n     harder. Chill be plain with you.\r\n  Osw. Out, dunghill!\r\n                                                     They fight.\r\n  Edg. Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your\r\nfoins.\r\n                                                 [Oswald falls.]\r\n  Osw. Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.\r\n     If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,\r\n     And give the letters which thou find'st about me\r\n     To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out\r\n     Upon the British party. O, untimely death! Death!\r\n                                                        He dies.\r\n  Edg. I know thee well. A serviceable villain,\r\n     As duteous to the vices of thy mistress\r\n     As badness would desire.\r\n  Glou. What, is he dead?\r\n  Edg. Sit you down, father; rest you.\r\n     Let's see his pockets; these letters that he speaks of\r\n     May be my friends. He's dead. I am only sorry\r\n     He had no other deathsman. Let us see.\r\n     Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.\r\n     To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;\r\n     Their papers, is more lawful.             Reads the letter.\r\n\r\n       'Let our reciprocal vows be rememb'red. You have many\r\n     opportunities to cut him off. If your will want not, time\r\nand\r\n     place will be fruitfully offer'd. There is nothing done, if\r\nhe\r\n     return the conqueror.

Here in the sands\r\n     Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified\r\n     Of murtherous lechers; and in the mature time\r\n     With this ungracious paper strike the sight\r\n     Of the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis well\r\n     That of thy death and business I can tell.\r\n  Glou. The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,\r\n     That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling\r\n     Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract.\r\n     So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,\r\n     And woes by wrong imaginations lose\r\n     The knowledge of themselves.\r\n                                                A drum afar off.\r\n  Edg. Give me your hand.\r\n     Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.\r\n     Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.        Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene VII.\r\nA tent in the French camp.\r\n\r\nEnter Cordelia, Kent, Doctor, and Gentleman.\r\n\r\n  Cor. O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work\r\n     To match thy goodness? My life will be too short\r\n     And every measure fail me.\r\n  Kent. To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid.\r\n     All my reports go with the modest truth;\r\n     Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.\r\n  Cor. Be better suited.\r\n     These weeds are memories of those worser hours.\r\n     I prithee put them off.\r\n  Kent. Pardon, dear madam.\r\n     Yet to be known shortens my made intent.\r\n     My boon I make it that you know me not\r\n     Till time and I think meet.\r\n  Cor. Then be't so, my good lord. [To the Doctor] How, does the\r\nKing?\r\n  Doct. Madam, sleeps still.\r\n  Cor. O you kind gods,\r\n     Cure this great breach in his abused nature!\r\n     Th' untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind up\r\n     Of this child-changed father!\r\n  Doct. So please your Majesty\r\n     That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.\r\n  Cor. Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed\r\n     I' th' sway of your own will. Is he array'd?\r\n\r\n              Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants.\r\n\r\n  Gent. Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep\r\n     We put fresh garments on him.\r\n  Doct. Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.\r\n     I doubt not of his temperance.\r\n  Cor. Very well.\r\n                                                          Music.\r\n  Doct. Please you draw near. Louder the music there!\r\n  Cor. O my dear father, restoration hang\r\n     Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss\r\n     Repair those violent harms that my two sisters\r\n     Have in thy reverence made!\r\n  Kent. Kind and dear princess!\r\n  Cor. Had you not been their father, these white flakes\r\n     Had challeng'd pity of them. Was this a face\r\n     To be oppos'd against the warring winds?\r\n     To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?\r\n     In the most terrible and nimble stroke\r\n     Of quick cross lightning? to watch- poor perdu!-\r\n     With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,\r\n     Though he had bit me, should have stood that night\r\n     Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,\r\n     To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,\r\n     In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!\r\n     'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once\r\n     Had not concluded all.- He wakes. Speak to him.\r\n  Doct. Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.\r\n  Cor. How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?\r\n  Lear. You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.\r\n     Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound\r\n     Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears\r\n     Do scald like molten lead.\r\n  Cor. Sir, do you know me?\r\n  Lear. You are a spirit, I know. When did you die?\r\n  Cor. Still, still, far wide!\r\n  Doct. He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.\r\n  Lear. Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,\r\n     I am mightily abus'd. I should e'en die with pity,\r\n     To see another thus. I know not what to say.\r\n     I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see.\r\n     I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd\r\n     Of my condition!\r\n  Cor. O, look upon me, sir,\r\n     And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.\r\n     No, sir, you must not kneel.\r\n  Lear. Pray, do not mock me.\r\n     I am a very foolish fond old man,\r\n     Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;\r\n     And, to deal plainly,\r\n     I fear I am not in my perfect mind.\r\n     Methinks I should know you, and know this man;\r\n     Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant\r\n     What place this is; and all the skill I have\r\n     Remembers not these garments; nor I know not\r\n     Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;\r\n     For (as I am a man) I think this lady\r\n     To be my child Cordelia.\r\n  Cor. And so I am! I am!\r\n  Lear. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.\r\n     If you have poison for me, I will drink it.\r\n     I know you do not love me; for your sisters\r\n     Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.\r\n     You have some cause, they have not.\r\n  Cor. No cause, no cause.\r\n  Lear. Am I in France?\r\n  Kent. In your own kingdom, sir.\r\n  Lear. Do not abuse me.\r\n  Doct. Be comforted, good madam. The great rage\r\n     You see is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger\r\n     To make him even o'er the time he has lost.\r\n     Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more\r\n     Till further settling.\r\n  Cor. Will't please your Highness walk?\r\n  Lear. You must bear with me.\r\n     Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.\r\n                              Exeunt. Manent Kent and Gentleman.\r\n  Gent. Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so\r\nslain?\r\n  Kent. Most certain, sir.\r\n  Gent. Who is conductor of his people?\r\n  Kent. As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.\r\n  Gent. They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of\r\nKent\r\n     in Germany.\r\n  Kent. Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers\r\nof\r\n     the kingdom approach apace.\r\n  Gent. The arbitrement is like to be bloody.\r\n     Fare you well, sir.                                 [Exit.]\r\n  Kent. My point and period will be throughly wrought,\r\n     Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,\r\n     Or whether since he is advis'd by aught\r\n     To change the course. He's full of alteration\r\n     And self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure.\r\n                                              [Exit an Officer.]\r\n  Reg. Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.\r\n  Edm. Tis to be doubted, madam.\r\n  Reg. Now, sweet lord,\r\n     You know the goodness I intend upon you.\r\n     Tell me- but truly- but then speak the truth-\r\n     Do you not love my sister?\r\n  Edm. In honour'd love.\r\n  Reg. But have you never found my brother's way\r\n     To the forfended place?\r\n  Edm. That thought abuses you.\r\n  Reg. I am doubtful that you have been conjunct\r\n     And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.\r\n  Edm. No, by mine honour, madam.\r\n  Reg. I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,\r\n     Be not familiar with her.\r\n  Edm. Fear me not.\r\n     She and the Duke her husband!\r\n\r\n       Enter, with Drum and Colours, Albany, Goneril, Soldiers.\r\n\r\n  Gon. [aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister\r\n     Should loosen him and me.\r\n  Alb. Our very loving sister, well bemet.\r\n     Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter,\r\n     With others whom the rigour of our state\r\n     Forc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest,\r\n     I never yet was valiant. For this business,\r\n     It toucheth us as France invades our land,\r\n     Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,\r\n     Most just and heavy causes make oppose.\r\n  Edm. Sir, you speak nobly.\r\n  Reg. Why is this reason'd?\r\n  Gon. Combine together 'gainst the enemy;\r\n     For these domestic and particular broils\r\n     Are not the question here.\r\n  Alb. Let's then determine\r\n     With th' ancient of war on our proceeding.\r\n  Edm. I shall attend you presently at your tent.\r\n  Reg. Sister, you'll go with us?\r\n  Gon. No.\r\n  Reg. 'Tis most convenient. Pray you go with us.\r\n  Gon. [aside] O, ho, I know the riddle.- I will go.\r\n\r\n          [As they are going out,] enter Edgar [disguised].\r\n\r\n  Edg. If e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor,\r\n     Hear me one word.\r\n  Alb. I'll overtake you.- Speak.\r\n                              Exeunt [all but Albany and Edgar].\r\n  Edg. Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.\r\n     If you have victory, let the trumpet sound\r\n     For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,\r\n     I can produce a champion that will prove\r\n     What is avouched there. If you miscarry,\r\n     Your business of the world hath so an end,\r\n     And machination ceases. Fortune love you!\r\n  Alb. Stay till I have read the letter.\r\n  Edg. I was forbid it.\r\n     When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,\r\n     And I'll appear again.\r\n  Alb. Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.\r\n                                                   Exit [Edgar].\r\n\r\n                            Enter Edmund.\r\n\r\n  Edm. The enemy 's in view; draw up your powers.\r\n     Here is the guess of their true strength and forces\r\n     By diligent discovery; but your haste\r\n     Is now urg'd on you.\r\n  Alb. We will greet the time.                             Exit.\r\n  Edm. To both these sisters have I sworn my love;\r\n     Each jealous of the other, as the stung\r\n     Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?\r\n     Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,\r\n     If both remain alive. To take the widow\r\n     Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;\r\n     And hardly shall I carry out my side,\r\n     Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use\r\n     His countenance for the battle, which being done,\r\n     Let her who would be rid of him devise\r\n     His speedy taking off. As for the mercy\r\n     Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia-\r\n     The battle done, and they within our power,\r\n     Shall never see his pardon; for my state\r\n     Stands on me to defend, not to debate.                Exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II.\r\nA field between the two camps.\r\n\r\nAlarum within.

Here, father, take the shadow of this tree\r\n     For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.\r\n     If ever I return to you again,\r\n     I'll bring you comfort.\r\n  Glou. Grace go with you, sir!\r\n                                                   Exit [Edgar].\r\n\r\n               Alarum and retreat within. Enter Edgar,\r\n\r\n  Edg. Away, old man! give me thy hand! away!\r\n     King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.\r\n     Give me thy hand! come on!\r\n  Glou. No further, sir. A man may rot even here.\r\n  Edg. What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure\r\n     Their going hence, even as their coming hither;\r\n     Ripeness is all. Come on.\r\n  Glou. And that's true too.

Some officers take them away. Good guard\r\n     Until their greater pleasures first be known\r\n     That are to censure them.\r\n  Cor. We are not the first\r\n     Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.\r\n     For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;\r\n     Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.\r\n     Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?\r\n  Lear. No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.\r\n     We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.\r\n     When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down\r\n     And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,\r\n     And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh\r\n     At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues\r\n     Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-\r\n     Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out-\r\n     And take upon 's the mystery of things,\r\n     As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,\r\n     In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones\r\n     That ebb and flow by th' moon.\r\n  Edm. Take them away.\r\n  Lear. Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,\r\n     The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?\r\n     He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven\r\n     And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.\r\n     The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,\r\n     Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first.\r\n     Come.                  Exeunt [Lear and Cordelia, guarded].\r\n  Edm. Come hither, Captain; hark.\r\n     Take thou this note [gives a paper]. Go follow them to\r\nprison.\r\n     One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost\r\n     As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way\r\n     To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men\r\n     Are as the time is. To be tender-minded\r\n     Does not become a sword. Thy great employment\r\n     Will not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't,\r\n     Or thrive by other means.\r\n  Capt. I'll do't, my lord.\r\n  Edm. About it! and write happy when th' hast done.\r\n     Mark- I say, instantly; and carry it so\r\n     As I have set it down.\r\n  Capt. I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;\r\n     If it be man's work, I'll do't.                       Exit.\r\n\r\n          Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers.\r\n\r\n  Alb. Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,\r\n     And fortune led you well. You have the captives\r\n     Who were the opposites of this day's strife.\r\n     We do require them of you, so to use them\r\n     As we shall find their merits and our safety\r\n     May equally determine.\r\n  Edm. Sir, I thought it fit\r\n     To send the old and miserable King\r\n     To some retention and appointed guard;\r\n     Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,\r\n     To pluck the common bosom on his side\r\n     And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes\r\n     Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,\r\n     My reason all the same; and they are ready\r\n     To-morrow, or at further space, t' appear\r\n     Where you shall hold your session. At this time\r\n     We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;\r\n     And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd\r\n     By those that feel their sharpness.\r\n     The question of Cordelia and her father\r\n     Requires a fitter place.\r\n  Alb. Sir, by your patience,\r\n     I hold you but a subject of this war,\r\n     Not as a brother.\r\n  Reg. That's as we list to grace him.\r\n     Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded\r\n     Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,\r\n     Bore the commission of my place and person,\r\n     The which immediacy may well stand up\r\n     And call itself your brother.\r\n  Gon. Not so hot!\r\n     In his own grace he doth exalt himself\r\n     More than in your addition.\r\n  Reg. In my rights\r\n     By me invested, he compeers the best.\r\n  Gon. That were the most if he should husband you.\r\n  Reg. Jesters do oft prove prophets.\r\n  Gon. Holla, holla!\r\n     That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.\r\n  Reg. Lady, I am not well; else I should answer\r\n     From a full-flowing stomach. General,\r\n     Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;\r\n     Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.\r\n     Witness the world that I create thee here\r\n     My lord and master.\r\n  Gon. Mean you to enjoy him?\r\n  Alb. The let-alone lies not in your good will.\r\n  Edm. Nor in thine, lord.\r\n  Alb. Half-blooded fellow, yes.\r\n  Reg. [to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.\r\n\r\n  Alb. Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee\r\n     On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,\r\n     This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim,\r\nfair\r\n        sister,\r\n     I bar it in the interest of my wife.\r\n     'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,\r\n     And I, her husband, contradict your banes.\r\n     If you will marry, make your loves to me;\r\n     My lady is bespoke.\r\n  Gon. An interlude!\r\n  Alb. Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.\r\n     If none appear to prove upon thy person\r\n     Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,\r\n     There is my pledge [throws down a glove]! I'll prove it on\r\nthy\r\n        heart,\r\n     Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less\r\n     Than I have here proclaim'd thee.\r\n  Reg. Sick, O, sick!\r\n  Gon. [aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.\r\n  Edm. There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the\r\nworld\r\n        he is\r\n     That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.\r\n     Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,\r\n     On him, on you, who not? I will maintain\r\n     My truth and honour firmly.\r\n  Alb. A herald, ho!\r\n  Edm. A herald, ho, a herald!\r\n  Alb. Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,\r\n     All levied in my name, have in my name\r\n     Took their discharge.\r\n  Reg. My sickness grows upon me.\r\n  Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.\r\n                                              [Exit Regan, led.]\r\n\r\n                           Enter a Herald.\r\n\r\n     Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,\r\n     And read out this.\r\n  Capt. Sound, trumpet!                        A trumpet sounds.\r\n\r\n  Her. (reads) 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists\r\nof\r\n     the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of\r\nGloucester,\r\n     that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third\r\nsound\r\n     of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'\r\n\r\n  Edm. Sound!                                     First trumpet.\r\n  Her. Again!                                    Second trumpet.\r\n  Her. Again!                                     Third trumpet.\r\n                                         Trumpet answers within.\r\n\r\n    Enter Edgar, armed, at the third sound, a Trumpet before him.\r\n\r\n  Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he appears\r\n     Upon this call o' th' trumpet.\r\n  Her. What are you?\r\n     Your name, your quality? and why you answer\r\n     This present summons?\r\n  Edg. Know my name is lost;\r\n     By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.\r\n     Yet am I noble as the adversary\r\n     I come to cope.\r\n  Alb. Which is that adversary?\r\n  Edg. What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?\r\n  Edm. Himself. What say'st thou to him?\r\n  Edg. Draw thy sword,\r\n     That, if my speech offend a noble heart,\r\n     Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.\r\n     Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,\r\n     My oath, and my profession. I protest-\r\n     Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,\r\n     Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,\r\n     Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor;\r\n     False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;\r\n     Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;\r\n     And from th' extremest upward of thy head\r\n     To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,\r\n     A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'\r\n     This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent\r\n     To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,\r\n     Thou liest.\r\n  Edm. In wisdom I should ask thy name;\r\n     But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,\r\n     And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,\r\n     What safe and nicely I might well delay\r\n     By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.\r\n     Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;\r\n     With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;\r\n     Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-\r\n     This sword of mine shall give them instant way\r\n     Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!\r\n                                 Alarums. Fight. [Edmund falls.]\r\n  Alb. Save him, save him!\r\n  Gon. This is mere practice, Gloucester.\r\n     By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer\r\n     An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,\r\n     But cozen'd and beguil'd.\r\n  Alb. Shut your mouth, dame,\r\n     Or with this paper shall I stop it. [Shows her her letter to\r\n     Edmund.]- [To Edmund]. Hold, sir.\r\n     [To Goneril] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.\r\n     No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it.\r\n  Gon. Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.\r\n     Who can arraign me for't?\r\n  Alb. Most monstrous!\r\n     Know'st thou this paper?\r\n  Gon. Ask me not what I know.                             Exit.\r\n  Alb. Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.\r\n                                              [Exit an Officer.]\r\n  Edm. What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,\r\n     And more, much more. The time will bring it out.\r\n     'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou\r\n     That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,\r\n     I do forgive thee.\r\n  Edg. Let's exchange charity.\r\n     I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;\r\n     If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me.\r\n     My name is Edgar and thy father's son.\r\n     The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices\r\n     Make instruments to scourge us.\r\n     The dark and vicious place where thee he got\r\n     Cost him his eyes.\r\n  Edm. Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true.\r\n     The wheel is come full circle; I am here.\r\n  Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesy\r\n     A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.\r\n     Let sorrow split my heart if ever I\r\n     Did hate thee, or thy father!\r\n  Edg. Worthy prince, I know't.\r\n  Alb. Where have you hid yourself?\r\n     How have you known the miseries of your father?\r\n  Edg. By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;\r\n     And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!\r\n     The bloody proclamation to escape\r\n     That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!\r\n     That with the pain of death would hourly die\r\n     Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift\r\n     Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance\r\n     That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit\r\n     Met I my father with his bleeding rings,\r\n     Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,\r\n     Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;\r\n     Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him\r\n     Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd,\r\n     Not sure, though hoping of this good success,\r\n     I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last\r\n     Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart\r\n     (Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)\r\n     'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,\r\n     Burst smilingly.\r\n  Edm. This speech of yours hath mov'd me,\r\n     And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;\r\n     You look as you had something more to say.\r\n  Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in;\r\n     For I am almost ready to dissolve,\r\n     Hearing of this.\r\n  Edg. This would have seem'd a period\r\n     To such as love not sorrow; but another,\r\n     To amplify too much, would make much more,\r\n     And top extremity.\r\n     Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man,\r\n     Who, having seen me in my worst estate,\r\n     Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding\r\n     Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms\r\n     He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out\r\n     As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;\r\n     Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him\r\n     That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting\r\n     His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life\r\n     Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,\r\n     And there I left him tranc'd.\r\n  Alb. But who was this?\r\n  Edg. Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise\r\n     Followed his enemy king and did him service\r\n     Improper for a slave.\r\n\r\n                Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife.\r\n\r\n  Gent. Help, help! O, help!\r\n  Edg. What kind of help?\r\n  Alb. Speak, man.\r\n  Edg. What means that bloody knife?\r\n  Gent. 'Tis hot, it smokes.\r\n     It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead!\r\n  Alb. Who dead? Speak, man.\r\n  Gent. Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister\r\n     By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.\r\n  Edm. I was contracted to them both. All three\r\n     Now marry in an instant.\r\n\r\n                             Enter Kent.\r\n\r\n  Edg. Here comes Kent.\r\n  Alb. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.\r\n                                               [Exit Gentleman.]\r\n     This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble\r\n     Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?\r\n     The time will not allow the compliment\r\n     That very manners urges.\r\n  Kent. I am come\r\n     To bid my king and master aye good night.\r\n     Is he not here?\r\n  Alb. Great thing of us forgot!\r\n     Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?\r\n                 The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.\r\n     Seest thou this object, Kent?\r\n  Kent. Alack, why thus?\r\n  Edm. Yet Edmund was belov'd.\r\n     The one the other poisoned for my sake,\r\n     And after slew herself.\r\n  Alb. Even so. Cover their faces.\r\n  Edm. I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,\r\n     Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send\r\n     (Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ\r\n     Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.\r\n     Nay, send in time.\r\n  Alb. Run, run, O, run!\r\n  Edg. To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send\r\n     Thy token of reprieve.\r\n  Edm. Well thought on. Take my sword;\r\n     Give it the Captain.\r\n  Alb. Haste thee for thy life.                    [Exit Edgar.]\r\n  Edm. He hath commission from thy wife and me\r\n     To hang Cordelia in the prison and\r\n     To lay the blame upon her own despair\r\n     That she fordid herself.\r\n  Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.\r\n                                          [Edmund is borne off.]\r\n\r\n    Enter Lear, with Cordelia [dead] in his arms, [Edgar,\r\nCaptain,\r\n                        and others following].\r\n\r\n  Lear. Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.\r\n     Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so\r\n     That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!\r\n     I know when one is dead, and when one lives.\r\n     She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.\r\n     If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,\r\n     Why, then she lives.\r\n  Kent. Is this the promis'd end?\r\n  Edg. Or image of that horror?\r\n  Alb. Fall and cease!\r\n  Lear. This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,\r\n     It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows\r\n     That ever I have felt.\r\n  Kent. O my good master!\r\n  Lear. Prithee away!\r\n  Edg. 'Tis noble Kent, your friend.\r\n  Lear. A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!\r\n     I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!\r\n     Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!\r\n     What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,\r\n     Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.\r\n     I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.\r\n  Capt. 'Tis true, my lords, he did.\r\n  Lear. Did I not, fellow?\r\n     I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion\r\n     I would have made them skip. I am old now,\r\n     And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?\r\n     Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.\r\n  Kent. If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,\r\n     One of them we behold.\r\n  Lear. This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?\r\n  Kent. The same-\r\n     Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?\r\n  Lear. He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.\r\n     He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.\r\n  Kent. No, my good lord; I am the very man-\r\n  Lear. I'll see that straight.\r\n  Kent. That from your first of difference and decay\r\n     Have followed your sad steps.\r\n  Lear. You're welcome hither.\r\n  Kent. Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.\r\n     Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,\r\n     And desperately are dead.\r\n  Lear. Ay, so I think.\r\n  Alb. He knows not what he says; and vain is it\r\n     That we present us to him.\r\n  Edg. Very bootless.\r\n\r\n                           Enter a Captain.\r\n\r\n  Capt. Edmund is dead, my lord.\r\n  Alb. That's but a trifle here.\r\n     You lords and noble friends, know our intent.\r\n     What comfort to this great decay may come\r\n     Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,\r\n     During the life of this old Majesty,\r\n     To him our absolute power; [to Edgar and Kent] you to your\r\n        rights;\r\n     With boot, and Such addition as your honours\r\n     Have more than merited.- All friends shall taste\r\n     The wages of their virtue, and all foes\r\n     The cup of their deservings.- O, see, see!\r\n  Lear. And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!\r\n     Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,\r\n     And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,\r\n     Never, never, never, never, never!\r\n     Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.\r\n     Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!\r\n     Look there, look there!                            He dies.\r\n  Edg. He faints! My lord, my lord!\r\n  Kent. Break, heart; I prithee break!\r\n  Edg. Look up, my lord.\r\n  Kent. Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him\r\n     That would upon the rack of this tough world\r\n     Stretch him out longer.\r\n  Edg. He is gone indeed.\r\n  Kent. The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.\r\n     He but usurp'd his life.\r\n  Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business\r\n     Is general woe. [To Kent and Edgar] Friends of my soul, you\r\n        twain\r\n     Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.\r\n  Kent. I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.\r\n     My master calls me; I must not say no.\r\n  Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,\r\n     Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\r\n     The oldest have borne most; we that are young\r\n     Shall never see so much, nor live so long.\r\n                                       Exeunt with a dead march.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

In sooth I know not why I am so sad,\r\nIt wearies me: you say it wearies you;\r\nBut how I caught it, found it, or came by it,\r\nWhat stuffe 'tis made of, whereof it is borne,\r\nI am to learne: and such a Want-wit sadnesse makes of\r\nmee,\r\nThat I haue much ado to know my selfe\r\n\r\n   Sal. Your minde is tossing on the Ocean,\r\nThere where your Argosies with portly saile\r\nLike Signiors and rich Burgers on the flood,\r\nOr as it were the Pageants of the sea,\r\nDo ouer-peere the pettie Traffiquers\r\nThat curtsie to them, do them reuerence\r\nAs they flye by them with their wouen wings\r\n\r\n   Salar. Beleeue me sir, had I such venture forth,\r\nThe better part of my affections, would\r\nBe with my hopes abroad. I should be still\r\nPlucking the grasse to know where sits the winde,\r\nPeering in Maps for ports, and peers, and rodes:\r\nAnd euery obiect that might make me feare\r\nMisfortune to my ventures, out of doubt\r\nWould make me sad\r\n\r\n   Sal. My winde cooling my broth,\r\nWould blow me to an Ague, when I thought\r\nWhat harme a winde too great might doe at sea.\r\nI should not see the sandie houre-glasse runne,\r\nBut I should thinke of shallows, and of flats,\r\nAnd see my wealthy Andrew docks in sand,\r\nVailing her high top lower then her ribs\r\nTo kisse her buriall; should I goe to Church\r\nAnd see the holy edifice of stone,\r\nAnd not bethinke me straight of dangerous rocks,\r\nWhich touching but my gentle Vessels side\r\nWould scatter all her spices on the streame,\r\nEnrobe the roring waters with my silkes,\r\nAnd in a word, but euen now worth this,\r\nAnd now worth nothing. Shall I haue the thought\r\nTo thinke on this, and shall I lacke the thought\r\nThat such a thing bechaunc'd would make me sad?\r\nBut tell me, I know Anthonio\r\nIs sad to thinke vpon his merchandize\r\n\r\n   Anth. Beleeue me no, I thanke my fortune for it,\r\nMy ventures are not in one bottome trusted,\r\nNor to one place; nor is my whole estate\r\nVpon the fortune of this present yeere:\r\nTherefore my merchandize makes me not sad\r\n\r\n   Sola. Why then you are in loue\r\n\r\n   Anth. Fie, fie\r\n\r\n   Sola. Not in loue neither: then let vs say you are sad\r\nBecause you are not merry: and 'twere as easie\r\nFor you to laugh and leape, and say you are merry\r\nBecause you are not sad. Now by two-headed Ianus,\r\nNature hath fram'd strange fellowes in her time:\r\nSome that will euermore peepe through their eyes,\r\nAnd laugh like Parrats at a bag-piper.\r\nAnd other of such vineger aspect,\r\nThat they'll not shew their teeth in way of smile,\r\nThough Nestor sweare the iest be laughable.\r\nEnter Bassanio, Lorenso, and Gratiano.\r\n\r\n  Sola. Heere comes Bassanio,\r\nYour most noble Kinsman,\r\nGratiano, and Lorenso. Faryewell,\r\nWe leaue you now with better company\r\n\r\n   Sala. I would haue staid till I had made you merry,\r\nIf worthier friends had not preuented me\r\n\r\n   Ant. Your worth is very deere in my regard.\r\nI take it your owne busines calls on you,\r\nAnd you embrace th' occasion to depart\r\n\r\n   Sal. Good morrow my good Lords\r\n\r\n   Bass. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?\r\nYou grow exceeding strange: must it be so?\r\n  Sal. Wee'll make our leysures to attend on yours.\r\n\r\nExeunt. Salarino, and Solanio.\r\n\r\n  Lor. My Lord Bassanio, since you haue found Anthonio\r\nWe two will leaue you, but at dinner time\r\nI pray you haue in minde where we must meete\r\n\r\n   Bass. I will not faile you\r\n\r\n   Grat. You looke not well signior Anthonio,\r\nYou haue too much respect vpon the world:\r\nThey loose it that doe buy it with much care,\r\nBeleeue me you are maruellously chang'd\r\n\r\n   Ant. I hold the world but as the world Gratiano,\r\nA stage, where euery man must play a part,\r\nAnd mine a sad one\r\n\r\n   Grati. Let me play the foole,\r\nWith mirth and laughter let old wrinckles come,\r\nAnd let my Liuer rather heate with wine,\r\nThen my heart coole with mortifying grones.\r\nWhy should a man whose bloud is warme within,\r\nSit like his Grandsire, cut in Alablaster?\r\nSleepe when he wakes? and creep into the Iaundies\r\nBy being peeuish? I tell thee what Anthonio,\r\nI loue thee, and it is my loue that speakes:\r\nThere are a sort of men, whose visages\r\nDo creame and mantle like a standing pond,\r\nAnd do a wilfull stilnesse entertaine,\r\nWith purpose to be drest in an opinion\r\nOf wisedome, grauity, profound conceit,\r\nAs who should say, I am sir an Oracle,\r\nAnd when I ope my lips, let no dogge barke.\r\nO my Anthonio, I do know of these\r\nThat therefore onely are reputed wise,\r\nFor saying nothing; when I am verie sure\r\nIf they should speake, would almost dam those eares\r\nWhich hearing them would call their brothers fooles:\r\nIle tell thee more of this another time.\r\nBut fish not with this melancholly baite\r\nFor this foole Gudgin, this opinion:\r\nCome good Lorenzo, faryewell a while,\r\nIle end my exhortation after dinner\r\n\r\n   Lor. Well, we will leaue you then till dinner time.\r\nI must be one of these same dumbe wise men.\r\nFor Gratiano neuer let's me speake\r\n\r\n   Gra. Well, keepe me company but two yeares mo,\r\nThou shalt not know the sound of thine owne tongue\r\n\r\n   Ant. Far you well, Ile grow a talker for this geare\r\n\r\n   Gra. Thankes ifaith, for silence is onely commendable\r\nIn a neats tongue dri'd, and a maid not vendible.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Ant. It is that any thing now\r\n\r\n   Bas. Gratiano speakes an infinite deale of nothing,\r\nmore then any man in all Venice, his reasons are two\r\ngraines of wheate hid in two bushels of chaffe: you shall\r\nseeke all day ere you finde them, & when you haue them\r\nthey are not worth the search\r\n\r\n   An. Well: tel me now, what Lady is the same\r\nTo whom you swore a secret Pilgrimage\r\nThat you to day promis'd to tel me of?\r\n  Bas. Tis not vnknowne to you Anthonio\r\nHow much I haue disabled mine estate,\r\nBy something shewing a more swelling port\r\nThen my faint meanes would grant continuance:\r\nNor do I now make mone to be abridg'd\r\nFrom such a noble rate, but my cheefe care\r\nIs to come fairely off from the great debts\r\nWherein my time something too prodigall\r\nHath left me gag'd: to you Anthonio\r\nI owe the most in money, and in loue,\r\nAnd from your loue I haue a warrantie\r\nTo vnburthen all my plots and purposes,\r\nHow to get cleere of all the debts I owe\r\n\r\n   An. I pray you good Bassanio let me know it,\r\nAnd if it stand as you your selfe still do,\r\nWithin the eye of honour, be assur'd\r\nMy purse, my person, my extreamest meanes\r\nLye all vnlock'd to your occasions\r\n\r\n   Bass. In my schoole dayes, when I had lost one shaft\r\nI shot his fellow of the selfesame flight\r\nThe selfesame way, with more aduised watch\r\nTo finde the other forth, and by aduenturing both,\r\nI oft found both. I vrge this child-hoode proofe,\r\nBecause what followes is pure innocence.\r\nI owe you much, and like a wilfull youth,\r\nThat which I owe is lost: but if you please\r\nTo shoote another arrow that selfe way\r\nWhich you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\r\nAs I will watch the ayme: Or to finde both,\r\nOr bring your latter hazard backe againe,\r\nAnd thankfully rest debter for the first\r\n\r\n   An. You know me well, and herein spend but time\r\nTo winde about my loue with circumstance,\r\nAnd out of doubt you doe more wrong\r\nIn making question of my vttermost\r\nThen if you had made waste of all I haue:\r\nThen doe but say to me what I should doe\r\nThat in your knowledge may by me be done,\r\nAnd I am prest vnto it: therefore speake\r\n\r\n   Bass. In Belmont is a Lady richly left,\r\nAnd she is faire, and fairer then that word,\r\nOf wondrous vertues, sometimes from her eyes\r\nI did receiue faire speechlesse messages:\r\nHer name is Portia, nothing vndervallewd\r\nTo Cato's daughter, Brutus Portia,\r\nNor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,\r\nFor the four windes blow in from euery coast\r\nRenowned sutors, and her sunny locks\r\nHang on her temples like a golden fleece,\r\nWhich makes her seat of Belmont Cholchos strond,\r\nAnd many Iasons come in quest of her.\r\nO my Anthonio, had I but the meanes\r\nTo hold a riuall place with one of them,\r\nI haue a minde presages me such thrift,\r\nThat I should questionlesse be fortunate\r\n\r\n   Anth. Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea,\r\nNeither haue I money, nor commodity\r\nTo raise a present summe, therefore goe forth\r\nTry what my credit can in Venice doe,\r\nThat shall be rackt euen to the vttermost,\r\nTo furnish thee to Belmont to faire Portia.\r\nGoe presently enquire, and so will I\r\nWhere money is, and I no question make\r\nTo haue it of my trust, or for my sake.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nEnter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa.\r\n\r\n  Portia. By my troth Nerrissa, my little body is a wearie\r\nof this great world\r\n\r\n   Ner. You would be sweet Madam, if your miseries\r\nwere in the same abundance as your good fortunes are:\r\nand yet for ought I see, they are as sicke that surfet with\r\ntoo much, as they that starue with nothing; it is no smal\r\nhappinesse therefore to bee seated in the meane, superfluitie\r\ncomes sooner by white haires, but competencie\r\nliues longer\r\n\r\n   Portia. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd\r\n\r\n   Ner. They would be better if well followed\r\n\r\n   Portia. If to doe were as easie as to know what were\r\ngood to doe, Chappels had beene Churches, and poore\r\nmens cottages Princes Pallaces: it is a good Diuine that\r\nfollowes his owne instructions; I can easier teach twentie\r\nwhat were good to be done, then be one of the twentie\r\nto follow mine owne teaching: the braine may deuise\r\nlawes for the blood, but a hot temper leapes ore a\r\ncolde decree, such a hare is madnesse the youth, to skip\r\nore the meshes of good counsaile the cripple; but this\r\nreason is not in fashion to choose me a husband: O mee,\r\nthe word choose, I may neither choose whom I would,\r\nnor refuse whom I dislike, so is the wil of a liuing daughter\r\ncurb'd by the will of a dead father: it is not hard Nerrissa,\r\nthat I cannot choose one, nor refuse none\r\n\r\n   Ner. Your father was euer vertuous, and holy men\r\nat their death haue good inspirations, therefore the lotterie\r\nthat hee hath deuised in these three chests of gold,\r\nsiluer, and leade, whereof who chooses his meaning,\r\nchooses you, wil no doubt neuer be chosen by any rightly,\r\nbut one who you shall rightly loue: but what warmth\r\nis there in your affection towards any of these Princely\r\nsuters that are already come?\r\n  Por. I pray thee ouer-name them, and as thou namest\r\nthem, I will describe them, and according to my description\r\nleuell at my affection\r\n\r\n   Ner. First there is the Neopolitane Prince\r\n\r\n   Por. I that's a colt indeede, for he doth nothing but\r\ntalke of his horse, and hee makes it a great appropriation\r\nto his owne good parts that he can shoo him himselfe:\r\nI am much afraid my Ladie his mother plaid false\r\nwith a Smyth\r\n\r\n   Ner. Than is there the Countie Palentine\r\n\r\n   Por. He doth nothing but frowne (as who should\r\nsay, and you will not haue me, choose: he heares merrie\r\ntales and smiles not, I feare hee will proue the weeping\r\nPhylosopher when he growes old, being so full of vnmannerly\r\nsadnesse in his youth.) I had rather to be married\r\nto a deaths head with a bone in his mouth, then to either\r\nof these: God defend me from these two\r\n\r\n   Ner. How say you by the French Lord, Mounsier\r\nLe Boune?\r\n  Por. God made him, and therefore let him passe for a\r\nman, in truth I know it is a sinne to be a mocker, but he,\r\nwhy he hath a horse better then the Neopolitans, a better\r\nbad habite of frowning then the Count Palentine, he\r\nis euery man in no man, if a Trassell sing, he fals straight\r\na capring, he will fence with his owne shadow. If I should\r\nmarry him, I should marry twentie husbands: if hee\r\nwould despise me, I would forgiue him, for if he loue me\r\nto madnesse, I should neuer requite him\r\n\r\n   Ner. What say you then to Fauconbridge, the yong\r\nBaron of England?\r\n  Por. You know I say nothing to him, for hee vnderstands\r\nnot me, nor I him: he hath neither Latine, French,\r\nnor Italian, and you will come into the Court & sweare\r\nthat I haue a poore pennie-worth in the English: hee is a\r\nproper mans picture, but alas who can conuerse with a\r\ndumbe show? how odly he is suited, I thinke he bought\r\nhis doublet in Italie, his round hose in France, his bonnet\r\nin Germanie, and his behauiour euery where\r\n\r\n   Ner. What thinke you of the other Lord his neighbour?\r\n  Por. That he hath a neighbourly charitie in him, for\r\nhe borrowed a boxe of the eare of the Englishman, and\r\nswore he would pay him againe when hee was able: I\r\nthinke the Frenchman became his suretie, and seald vnder\r\nfor another\r\n\r\n   Ner. How like you the yong Germaine, the Duke of\r\nSaxonies Nephew?\r\n  Por. Very vildely in the morning when hee is sober,\r\nand most vildely in the afternoone when hee is drunke:\r\nwhen he is best, he is a little worse then a man, and when\r\nhe is worst, he is little better then a beast: and the worst\r\nfall that euer fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without\r\nhim\r\n\r\n   Ner. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right\r\nCasket, you should refuse to performe your Fathers will,\r\nif you should refuse to accept him\r\n\r\n   Por. Therefore for feare of the worst, I pray thee set\r\na deepe glasse of Reinish-wine on the contrary Casket,\r\nfor if the diuell be within, and that temptation without,\r\nI know he will choose it. I will doe any thing Nerrissa\r\nere I will be married to a spunge\r\n\r\n   Ner. You neede not feare Lady the hauing any of\r\nthese Lords, they haue acquainted me with their determinations,\r\nwhich is indeede to returne to their home,\r\nand to trouble you with no more suite, vnlesse you may\r\nbe won by some other sort then your Fathers imposition,\r\ndepending on the Caskets\r\n\r\n   Por. If I liue to be as olde as Sibilla, I will dye as\r\nchaste as Diana: vnlesse I be obtained by the manner\r\nof my Fathers will: I am glad this parcell of wooers\r\nare so reasonable, for there is not one among them but\r\nI doate on his verie absence: and I wish them a faire departure\r\n\r\n   Ner. Doe you not remember Ladie in your Fathers\r\ntime, a Venecian, a Scholler and a Souldior that\r\ncame hither in companie of the Marquesse of Mountferrat?\r\n  Por. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I thinke, so was hee\r\ncall'd\r\n\r\n   Ner. True Madam, hee of all the men that euer my\r\nfoolish eyes look'd vpon, was the best deseruing a faire\r\nLady\r\n\r\n   Por. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy\r\nof thy praise.\r\nEnter a Seruingman.\r\n\r\n  Ser. The four Strangers seeke you Madam to take\r\ntheir leaue: and there is a fore-runner come from a fift,\r\nthe Prince of Moroco, who brings word the Prince his\r\nMaister will be here to night\r\n\r\n   Por. If I could bid the fift welcome with so good\r\nheart as I can bid the other foure farewell, I should be\r\nglad of his approach: if he haue the condition of a Saint,\r\nand the complexion of a diuell, I had rather hee should\r\nshriue me then wiue me. Come Nerrissa, sirra go before;\r\nwhiles wee shut the gate vpon one wooer, another\r\nknocks at the doore.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nEnter Bassanio with Shylocke the Iew.\r\n\r\n  Shy. Three thousand ducates, well\r\n\r\n   Bass. I sir, for three months\r\n\r\n   Shy. For three months, well\r\n\r\n   Bass. For the which, as I told you,\r\nAnthonio shall be bound\r\n\r\n   Shy. Anthonio shall become bound, well\r\n\r\n   Bass. May you sted me? Will you pleasure me?\r\nShall I know your answere\r\n\r\n   Shy. Three thousand ducats for three months,\r\nand Anthonio bound\r\n\r\n   Bass. Your answere to that\r\n\r\n   Shy. Anthonio is a good man\r\n\r\n   Bass. Haue you heard any imputation to the contrary\r\n\r\n   Shy. Ho no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a\r\ngood man, is to haue you vnderstand me that he is sufficient,\r\nyet his meanes are in supposition: he hath an Argosie\r\nbound to Tripolis, another to the Indies, I vnderstand\r\nmoreouer vpon the Ryalta, he hath a third at Mexico,\r\na fourth for England, and other ventures hee hath\r\nsquandred abroad, but ships are but boords, Saylers but\r\nmen, there be land rats, and water rats, water theeues,\r\nand land theeues, I meane Pyrats, and then there is the\r\nperrill of waters, windes, and rocks: the man is not withstanding\r\nsufficient, three thousand ducats, I thinke I may\r\ntake his bond\r\n\r\n   Bas. Be assured you may\r\n\r\n   Iew. I will be assured I may: and that I may be assured,\r\nI will bethinke mee, may I speake with Anthonio?\r\n  Bass. If it please you to dine with vs\r\n\r\n   Iew. Yes, to smell porke, to eate of the habitation\r\nwhich your Prophet the Nazarite coniured the diuell\r\ninto: I will buy with you, sell with you, talke with\r\nyou, walke with you, and so following: but I will\r\nnot eate with you, drinke with you, nor pray with you.\r\nWhat newes on the Ryalta, who is he comes here?\r\nEnter Anthonio.\r\n\r\n  Bass. This is signior Anthonio\r\n\r\n   Iew. How like a fawning publican he lookes.\r\nI hate him for he is a Christian:\r\nBut more, for that in low simplicitie\r\nHe lends out money gratis, and brings downe\r\nThe rate of vsance here with vs in Venice.\r\nIf I can catch him once vpon the hip,\r\nI will feede fat the ancient grudge I beare him.\r\nHe hates our sacred Nation, and he railes\r\nEuen there where Merchants most doe congregate\r\nOn me, my bargaines, and my well-worne thrift,\r\nWhich he cals interrest: Cursed by my Trybe\r\nIf I forgiue him\r\n\r\n   Bass. Shylock, doe you heare\r\n\r\n   Shy. I am debating of my present store,\r\nAnd by the neere gesse of my memorie\r\nI cannot instantly raise vp the grosse\r\nOf full three thousand ducats: what of that?\r\nTuball a wealthy Hebrew of my Tribe\r\nWill furnish me: but soft, how many months\r\nDoe you desire? Rest you faire good signior,\r\nYour worship was the last man in our mouthes\r\n\r\n   Ant. Shylocke, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\r\nBy taking, nor by giuing of excesse,\r\nYet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\r\nIle breake a custome: is he yet possest\r\nHow much he would?\r\n  Shy. I, I, three thousand ducats\r\n\r\n   Ant. And for three months\r\n\r\n   Shy. I had forgot, three months, you told me so.\r\nWell then, your bond: and let me see, but heare you,\r\nMe thoughts you said, you neither lend nor borrow\r\nVpon aduantage\r\n\r\n   Ant. I doe neuer vse it\r\n\r\n   Shy. When Iacob graz'd his vncle Labans sheepe,\r\nThis Iacob from our holy Abram was\r\n(As his wise mother wrought in his behalfe)\r\nThe third possesser; I, he was the third\r\n\r\n   Ant. And what of him, did he take interrest?\r\n  Shy. No, not take interest, not as you would say\r\nDirectly interest, marke what Iacob did,\r\nWhen Laban and himselfe were compremyz'd\r\nThat all the eanelings which were streakt and pied\r\nShould fall as Iacobs hier, the Ewes being rancke,\r\nIn end of Autumne turned to the Rammes,\r\nAnd when the worke of generation was\r\nBetweene these woolly breeders in the act,\r\nThe skilfull shepheard pil'd me certaine wands,\r\nAnd in the dooing of the deede of kinde,\r\nHe stucke them vp before the fulsome Ewes,\r\nWho then conceauing, did in eaning time\r\nFall party-colour'd lambs, and those were Iacobs.\r\nThis was a way to thriue, and he was blest:\r\nAnd thrift is blessing if men steale it not\r\n\r\n   Ant. This was a venture sir that Iacob seru'd for,\r\nA thing not in his power to bring to passe,\r\nBut sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heauen.\r\nWas this inserted to make interrest good?\r\nOr is your gold and siluer Ewes and Rams?\r\n  Shy. I cannot tell, I make it breede as fast,\r\nBut note me signior\r\n\r\n   Ant. Marke you this Bassanio,\r\nThe diuell can cite Scripture for his purpose,\r\nAn euill soule producing holy witnesse,\r\nIs like a villaine with a smiling cheeke,\r\nA goodly apple rotten at the heart.\r\nO what a goodly outside falsehood hath\r\n\r\n   Shy. Three thousand ducats, 'tis a good round sum.\r\nThree months from twelue, then let me see the rate\r\n\r\n   Ant. Well Shylocke, shall we be beholding to you?\r\n  Shy. Signior Anthonio, many a time and oft\r\nIn the Ryalto you haue rated me\r\nAbout my monies and my vsances:\r\nStill haue I borne it with a patient shrug,\r\n(For suffrance is the badge of all our Tribe.)\r\nYou call me misbeleeuer, cut-throate dog,\r\nAnd spet vpon my Iewish gaberdine,\r\nAnd all for vse of that which is mine owne.\r\nWell then, it now appeares you neede my helpe:\r\nGoe to then, you come to me, and you say,\r\nShylocke, we would haue moneyes, you say so:\r\nYou that did voide your rume vpon my beard,\r\nAnd foote me as you spurne a stranger curre\r\nOuer your threshold, moneyes is your suite.\r\nWhat should I say to you? Should I not say,\r\nHath a dog money? Is it possible\r\nA curre should lend three thousand ducats? or\r\nShall I bend low, and in a bond-mans key\r\nWith bated breath, and whispring humblenesse,\r\nSay this: Faire sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;\r\nYou spurn'd me such a day; another time\r\nYou cald me dog: and for these curtesies\r\nIle lend you thus much moneyes\r\n\r\n   Ant. I am as like to call thee so againe,\r\nTo spet on thee againe, to spurne thee too.\r\nIf thou wilt lend this money, lend it not\r\nAs to thy friends, for when did friendship take\r\nA breede of barraine mettall of his friend?\r\nBut lend it rather to thine enemie,\r\nWho if he breake, thou maist with better face\r\nExact the penalties\r\n\r\n   Shy. Why looke you how you storme,\r\nI would be friends with you, and haue your loue,\r\nForget the shames that you haue staind me with,\r\nSupplie your present wants, and take no doite\r\nOf vsance for my moneyes, and youle not heare me,\r\nThis is kinde I offer\r\n\r\n   Bass. This were kindnesse\r\n\r\n   Shy. This kindnesse will I showe,\r\nGoe with me to a Notarie, seale me there\r\nYour single bond, and in a merrie sport\r\nIf you repaie me not on such a day,\r\nIn such a place, such sum or sums as are\r\nExprest in the condition, let the forfeite\r\nBe nominated for an equall pound\r\nOf your faire flesh, to be cut off and taken\r\nIn what part of your bodie it pleaseth me\r\n\r\n   Ant. Content infaith, Ile seale to such a bond,\r\nAnd say there is much kindnesse in the Iew\r\n\r\n   Bass. You shall not seale to such a bond for me,\r\nIle rather dwell in my necessitie\r\n\r\n   Ant. Why feare not man, I will not forfaite it,\r\nWithin these two months, that's a month before\r\nThis bond expires, I doe expect returne\r\nOf thrice three times the valew of this bond\r\n\r\n   Shy. O father Abram, what these Christians are,\r\nWhose owne hard dealings teaches them suspect\r\nThe thoughts of others: Praie you tell me this,\r\nIf he should breake his daie, what should I gaine\r\nBy the exaction of the forfeiture?\r\nA pound of mans flesh taken from a man,\r\nIs not so estimable, profitable neither\r\nAs flesh of Muttons, Beefes, or Goates, I say\r\nTo buy his fauour, I extend this friendship,\r\nIf he will take it, so: if not adiew,\r\nAnd for my loue I praie you wrong me not\r\n\r\n   Ant. Yes Shylocke, I will seale vnto this bond\r\n\r\n   Shy. Then meete me forthwith at the Notaries,\r\nGiue him direction for this merrie bond,\r\nAnd I will goe and purse the ducats straite.\r\nSee to my house left in the fearefull gard\r\nOf an vnthriftie knaue: and presentlie\r\nIle be with you.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Ant. Hie thee gentle Iew. This Hebrew will turne\r\nChristian, he growes kinde\r\n\r\n   Bass. I like not faire tearmes, and a villaines minde\r\n\r\n   Ant. Come on, in this there can be no dismaie,\r\nMy Shippes come home a month before the daie.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nActus Secundus.\r\n\r\nEnter Morochus a tawnie Moore all in white, and three or foure\r\nfollowers\r\naccordingly, with Portia, Nerrissa, and their traine. Flo. Cornets.\r\n\r\n  Mor. Mislike me not for my complexion,\r\nThe shadowed liuerie of the burnisht sunne,\r\nTo whom I am a neighbour, and neere bred.\r\nBring me the fairest creature North-ward borne,\r\nWhere Phoebus fire scarce thawes the ysicles,\r\nAnd let vs make incision for your loue,\r\nTo proue whose blood is reddest, his or mine.\r\nI tell thee Ladie this aspect of mine\r\nHath feard the valiant, (by my loue I sweare)\r\nThe best regarded Virgins of our Clyme\r\nHaue lou'd it to: I would not change this hue,\r\nExcept to steale your thoughts my gentle Queene\r\n\r\n   Por. In tearmes of choise I am not solie led\r\nBy nice direction of a maidens eies:\r\nBesides, the lottrie of my destenie\r\nBars me the right of voluntarie choosing:\r\nBut if my Father had not scanted me,\r\nAnd hedg'd me by his wit to yeelde my selfe\r\nHis wife, who wins me by that meanes I told you,\r\nYour selfe (renowned Prince) than stood as faire\r\nAs any commer I haue look'd on yet\r\nFor my affection\r\n\r\n   Mor. Euen for that I thanke you,\r\nTherefore I pray you leade me to the Caskets\r\nTo trie my fortune: By this Symitare\r\nThat slew the Sophie, and a Persian Prince\r\nThat won three fields of Sultan Solyman,\r\nI would ore-stare the sternest eies that looke:\r\nOut-braue the heart most daring on the earth:\r\nPlucke the yong sucking Cubs from the she Beare,\r\nYea, mocke the Lion when he rores for pray\r\nTo win the Ladie. But alas, the while\r\nIf Hercules and Lychas plaie at dice\r\nWhich is the better man, the greater throw\r\nMay turne by fortune from the weaker hand:\r\nSo is Alcides beaten by his rage,\r\nAnd so may I, blinde fortune leading me\r\nMisse that which one vnworthier may attaine,\r\nAnd die with grieuing\r\n\r\n   Port. You must take your chance,\r\nAnd either not attempt to choose at all,\r\nOr sweare before you choose, if you choose wrong\r\nNeuer to speake to Ladie afterward\r\nIn way of marriage, therefore be aduis'd\r\n\r\n   Mor. Nor will not, come bring me vnto my chance\r\n\r\n   Por. First forward to the temple, after dinner\r\nYour hazard shall be made\r\n\r\n   Mor. Good fortune then,\r\n\r\nCornets.\r\n\r\nTo make me blest or cursed'st among men.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nEnter the Clowne alone.\r\n\r\n  Clo. Certainely, my conscience will serue me to run\r\nfrom this Iew my Maister: the fiend is at mine elbow,\r\nand tempts me, saying to me, Iobbe, Launcelet Iobbe, good\r\nLauncelet, or good Iobbe, or good Launcelet Iobbe, vse\r\nyour legs, take the start, run awaie: my conscience saies\r\nno; take heede honest Launcelet, take heed honest Iobbe,\r\nor as afore-said honest Launcelet Iobbe, doe not runne,\r\nscorne running with thy heeles; well, the most coragious\r\nfiend bids me packe, fia saies the fiend, away saies\r\nthe fiend, for the heauens rouse vp a braue minde saies\r\nthe fiend, and run; well, my conscience hanging about\r\nthe necke of my heart, saies verie wisely to me: my honest\r\nfriend Launcelet, being an honest mans sonne, or rather\r\nan honest womans sonne, for indeede my Father did\r\nsomething smack, something grow too; he had a kinde of\r\ntaste; wel, my conscience saies Lancelet bouge not, bouge\r\nsaies the fiend, bouge not saies my conscience, conscience\r\nsay I you counsaile well, fiend say I you counsaile well,\r\nto be rul'd by my conscience I should stay with the Iew\r\nmy Maister, (who God blesse the marke) is a kinde of diuell;\r\nand to run away from the Iew I should be ruled by\r\nthe fiend, who sauing your reuerence is the diuell himselfe:\r\ncertainely the Iew is the verie diuell incarnation,\r\nand in my conscience, my conscience is a kinde of hard\r\nconscience, to offer to counsaile me to stay with the Iew;\r\nthe fiend giues the more friendly counsaile: I will runne\r\nfiend, my heeles are at your commandement, I will\r\nrunne.\r\nEnter old Gobbe with a Basket.\r\n\r\n  Gob.

O heauens, this is my true begotten Father, who\r\nbeing more then sand-blinde, high grauel blinde, knows\r\nme not, I will trie confusions with him\r\n\r\n\r\n   Gob. Maister yong Gentleman, I praie you which is\r\nthe waie to Maister Iewes\r\n\r\n   Laun. Turne vpon your right hand at the next turning,\r\nbut at the next turning of all on your left; marrie\r\nat the verie next turning, turne of no hand, but turn down\r\nindirectlie to the Iewes house\r\n\r\n   Gob. Be Gods sonties 'twill be a hard waie to hit, can\r\nyou tell me whether one Launcelet that dwels with him\r\ndwell with him or no\r\n\r\n   Laun. Talke you of yong Master Launcelet, marke\r\nme now, now will I raise the waters; talke you of yong\r\nMaister Launcelet?\r\n  Gob. No Maister sir, but a poore mans sonne, his Father\r\nthough I say't is an honest exceeding poore man,\r\nand God be thanked well to liue\r\n\r\n   Lan. Well, let his Father be what a will, wee talke of\r\nyong Maister Launcelet\r\n\r\n   Gob. Your worships friend and Launcelet\r\n\r\n   Laun. But I praie you ergo old man, ergo I beseech you,\r\ntalke you of yong Maister Launcelet\r\n\r\n   Gob. Of Launcelet, ant please your maistership\r\n\r\n   Lan. Ergo Maister Lancelet, talke not of maister Lancelet\r\nFather, for the yong gentleman according to fates and\r\ndestinies, and such odde sayings, the sisters three, & such\r\nbranches of learning, is indeede deceased, or as you\r\nwould say in plaine tearmes, gone to heauen\r\n\r\n   Gob. Marrie God forbid, the boy was the verie staffe\r\nof my age, my verie prop\r\n\r\n   Lau. Do I look like a cudgell or a houell-post, a staffe\r\nor a prop: doe you know me Father\r\n\r\n   Gob. Alacke the day, I know you not yong Gentleman,\r\nbut I praie you tell me, is my boy God rest his soule\r\naliue or dead\r\n\r\n   Lan. Doe you not know me Father\r\n\r\n   Gob. Alacke sir I am sand blinde, I know you not\r\n\r\n   Lan. Nay, indeede if you had your eies you might\r\nfaile of the knowing me: it is a wise Father that knowes\r\nhis owne childe. Well, old man, I will tell you newes of\r\nyour son, giue me your blessing, truth will come to light,\r\nmurder cannot be hid long, a mans sonne may, but in the\r\nend truth will out\r\n\r\n   Gob. Praie you sir stand vp, I am sure you are not\r\nLancelet my boy\r\n\r\n   Lan. Praie you let's haue no more fooling about\r\nit, but giue mee your blessing: I am Lancelet your\r\nboy that was, your sonne that is, your childe that\r\nshall be\r\n\r\n   Gob. I cannot thinke you are my sonne\r\n\r\n   Lan. I know not what I shall thinke of that: but I am\r\nLancelet the Iewes man, and I am sure Margerie your wife\r\nis my mother\r\n\r\n   Gob. Her name is Margerie indeede, Ile be sworne if\r\nthou be Lancelet, thou art mine owne flesh and blood:\r\nLord worshipt might he be, what a beard hast thou got;\r\nthou hast got more haire on thy chin, then Dobbin my\r\nphilhorse has on his taile\r\n\r\n   Lan. It should seeme then that Dobbins taile\r\ngrowes backeward. I am sure he had more haire of his\r\ntaile then I haue of my face when I last saw him\r\n\r\n   Gob. Lord how art thou chang'd: how doost thou\r\nand thy Master agree, I haue brought him a present; how\r\ngree you now?\r\n  Lan. Well, well, but for mine owne part, as I haue set\r\nvp my rest to run awaie, so I will not rest till I haue run\r\nsome ground; my Maister's a verie Iew, giue him a present,\r\ngiue him a halter, I am famisht in his seruice. You\r\nmay tell euerie finger I haue with my ribs: Father I am\r\nglad you are come, giue me your present to one Maister\r\nBassanio, who indeede giues rare new Liuories, if I serue\r\nnot him, I will run as far as God has anie ground. O rare\r\nfortune, here comes the man, to him Father, for I am a\r\nIew if I serue the Iew anie longer.\r\nEnter Bassanio with a follower or two.\r\n\r\n  Bass. You may doe so, but let it be so hasted that\r\nsupper be readie at the farthest by fiue of the clocke:\r\nsee these Letters deliuered, put the Liueries to making,\r\nand desire Gratiano to come anone to my lodging\r\n\r\n   Lan.

Not a poore boy sir, but the rich Iewes man that\r\nwould sir as my Father shall specifie\r\n\r\n   Gob. He hath a great infection sir, as one would say\r\nto serue\r\n\r\n   Lan. Indeede the short and the long is, I serue the\r\nIew, and haue a desire as my Father shall specifie\r\n\r\n   Gob. His Maister and he (sauing your worships reuerence)\r\nare scarce catercosins\r\n\r\n   Lan. To be briefe, the verie truth is, that the Iew\r\nhauing done me wrong, doth cause me as my Father being\r\nI hope an old man shall frutifie vnto you\r\n\r\n   Gob. I haue here a dish of Doues that I would bestow\r\nvpon your worship, and my suite is\r\n\r\n   Lan. In verie briefe, the suite is impertinent to my\r\nselfe, as your worship shall know by this honest old man,\r\nand though I say it, though old man, yet poore man my\r\nFather\r\n\r\n   Bass. One speake for both, what would you?\r\n  Lan. Serue you sir\r\n\r\n   Gob. That is the verie defect of the matter sir\r\n\r\n   Bass. I know thee well, thou hast obtain'd thy suite,\r\nShylocke thy Maister spoke with me this daie,\r\nAnd hath prefer'd thee, if it be preferment\r\nTo leaue a rich Iewes seruice, to become\r\nThe follower of so poore a Gentleman\r\n\r\n   Clo. The old prouerbe is verie well parted betweene\r\nmy Maister Shylocke and you sir, you haue the grace of\r\nGod sir, and he hath enough\r\n\r\n   Bass. Thou speak'st well; go Father with thy Son,\r\nTake leaue of thy old Maister, and enquire\r\nMy lodging out, giue him a Liuerie\r\nMore garded then his fellowes: see it done\r\n\r\n   Clo. Father in, I cannot get a seruice, no, I haue nere\r\na tongue in my head, well: if anie man in Italie haue a\r\nfairer table which doth offer to sweare vpon a booke, I\r\nshall haue good fortune; goe too, here's a simple line\r\nof life, here's a small trifle of wiues, alas, fifteene wiues\r\nis nothing, a leuen widdowes and nine maides is a simple\r\ncomming in for one man, and then to scape drowning\r\nthrice, and to be in perill of my life with the edge\r\nof a featherbed, here are simple scapes: well, if Fortune\r\nbe a woman, she's a good wench for this gere: Father\r\ncome, Ile take my leaue of the Iew in the twinkling.\r\n\r\nExit Clowne.\r\n\r\n  Bass.

A gentle scroule: Faire Lady, by your leaue,\r\nI come by note to giue, and to receiue,\r\nLike one of two contending in a prize\r\nThat thinks he hath done well in peoples eies:\r\nHearing applause and vniuersall shout,\r\nGiddie in spirit, still gazing in a doubt\r\nWhether those peales of praise be his or no.\r\nSo thrice faire Lady stand I euen so,\r\nAs doubtfull whether what I see be true,\r\nVntill confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you\r\n\r\n   Por. You see my Lord Bassiano where I stand,\r\nSuch as I am; though for my selfe alone\r\nI would not be ambitious in my wish,\r\nTo wish my selfe much better, yet for you,\r\nI would be trebled twenty times my selfe,\r\nA thousand times more faire, ten thousand times\r\nMore rich, that onely to stand high in your account,\r\nI might in vertues, beauties, liuings, friends,\r\nExceed account: but the full summe of me\r\nIs sum of nothing: which to terme in grosse,\r\nIs an vnlessoned girle, vnschool'd, vnpractiz'd,\r\nHappy in this, she is not yet so old\r\nBut she may learne: happier then this,\r\nShee is not bred so dull but she can learne;\r\nHappiest of all, is that her gentle spirit\r\nCommits it selfe to yours to be directed,\r\nAs from her Lord, her Gouernour, her King.\r\nMy selfe, and what is mine, to you and yours\r\nIs now conuerted. But now I was the Lord\r\nOf this faire mansion, master of my seruants,\r\nQueene ore my selfe: and euen now, but now,\r\nThis house, these seruants, and this same my selfe\r\nAre yours, my Lord, I giue them with this ring,\r\nWhich when you part from, loose, or giue away,\r\nLet it presage the ruine of your loue,\r\nAnd be my vantage to exclaime on you\r\n\r\n   Bass. Maddam, you haue bereft me of all words,\r\nOnely my bloud speakes to you in my vaines,\r\nAnd there is such confusion in my powers,\r\nAs after some oration fairely spoke\r\nBy a beloued Prince, there doth appeare\r\nAmong the buzzing pleased multitude,\r\nWhere euery something being blent together,\r\nTurnes to a wilde of nothing, saue of ioy\r\nExprest, and not exprest: but when this ring\r\nParts from this finger, then parts life from hence,\r\nO then be bold to say Bassanio's dead\r\n\r\n   Ner. My Lord and Lady, it is now our time\r\nThat haue stood by and seene our wishes prosper,\r\nTo cry good ioy, good ioy my Lord and Lady\r\n\r\n   Gra. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle Lady,\r\nI wish you all the ioy that you can wish:\r\nFor I am sure you can wish none from me:\r\nAnd when your Honours meane to solemnize\r\nThe bargaine of your faith: I doe beseech you\r\nEuen at that time I may be married too\r\n\r\n   Bass. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife\r\n\r\n   Gra. I thanke your Lordship, you haue got me one.\r\nMy eyes my Lord can looke as swift as yours:\r\nYou saw the mistres, I beheld the maid:\r\nYou lou'd, I lou'd for intermission,\r\nNo more pertaines to me my Lord then you;\r\nYour fortune stood vpon the caskets there,\r\nAnd so did mine too, as the matter falls:\r\nFor wooing heere vntill I swet againe,\r\nAnd swearing till my very rough was dry\r\nWith oathes of loue, at last, if promise last,\r\nI got a promise of this faire one heere\r\nTo haue her loue: prouided that your fortune\r\nAtchieu'd her mistresse\r\n\r\n   Por. Is this true Nerrissa?\r\n  Ner. Madam it is so, so you stand pleas'd withall\r\n\r\n   Bass. And doe you Gratiano meane good faith?\r\n  Gra. Yes faith my Lord\r\n\r\n   Bass. Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage\r\n\r\n   Gra. Weele play with them the first boy for a thousand\r\nducats\r\n\r\n   Ner. What and stake downe?\r\n  Gra. No, we shal nere win at that sport, and stake\r\ndowne.\r\nBut who comes heere? Lorenzo and his Infidell?\r\nWhat and my old Venetian friend Salerio?\r\nEnter Lorenzo, Iessica, and Salerio.\r\n\r\n  Bas. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hether,\r\nIf that the youth of my new interest heere\r\nHaue power to bid you welcome: by your leaue\r\nI bid my verie friends and Countrimen\r\nSweet Portia welcome\r\n\r\n   Por. So do I my Lord, they are intirely welcome\r\n\r\n   Lor. I thanke your honor; for my part my Lord,\r\nMy purpose was not to haue seene you heere,\r\nBut meeting with Salerio by the way,\r\nHe did intreate mee past all saying nay\r\nTo come with him along\r\n\r\n   Sal. I did my Lord,\r\nAnd I haue reason for it, Signior Anthonio\r\nCommends him to you\r\n\r\n   Bass. Ere I ope his Letter\r\nI pray you tell me how my good friend doth\r\n\r\n   Sal. Not sicke my Lord, vnlesse it be in minde,\r\nNor wel, vnlesse in minde: his Letter there\r\nWil shew you his estate.\r\n\r\nOpens the Letter.\r\n\r\n  Gra. Nerrissa, cheere yond stranger, bid her welcom.\r\nYour hand Salerio, what's the newes from Venice?\r\nHow doth that royal Merchant good Anthonio;\r\nI know he will be glad of our successe,\r\nWe are the Iasons, we haue won the fleece\r\n\r\n   Sal. I would you had won the fleece that hee hath\r\nlost\r\n\r\n   Por. There are some shrewd contents in yond same\r\nPaper,\r\nThat steales the colour from Bassianos cheeke,\r\nSome deere friend dead, else nothing in the world\r\nCould turne so much the constitution\r\nOf any constant man. What, worse and worse?\r\nWith leaue Bassanio I am halfe your selfe,\r\nAnd I must freely haue the halfe of any thing\r\nThat this same paper brings you\r\n\r\n   Bass. O sweet Portia,\r\nHeere are a few of the vnpleasant'st words\r\nThat euer blotted paper. Gentle Ladie\r\nWhen I did first impart my loue to you,\r\nI freely told you all the wealth I had\r\nRan in my vaines: I was a Gentleman,\r\nAnd then I told you true: and yet deere Ladie,\r\nRating my selfe at nothing, you shall see\r\nHow much I was a Braggart, when I told you\r\nMy state was nothing, I should then haue told you\r\nThat I was worse then nothing: for indeede\r\nI haue ingag'd my selfe to a deere friend,\r\nIngag'd my friend to his meere enemie\r\nTo feede my meanes. Heere is a Letter Ladie,\r\nThe paper as the bodie of my friend,\r\nAnd euerie word in it a gaping wound\r\nIssuing life blood. But is it true Salerio,\r\nHath all his ventures faild, what not one hit,\r\nFrom Tripolis, from Mexico and England,\r\nFrom Lisbon, Barbary, and India,\r\nAnd not one vessell scape the dreadfull touch\r\nOf Merchant-marring rocks?\r\n  Sal. Not one my Lord.\r\nBesides, it should appeare, that if he had\r\nThe present money to discharge the Iew,\r\nHe would not take it: neuer did I know\r\nA creature that did beare the shape of man\r\nSo keene and greedy to confound a man.\r\nHe plyes the Duke at morning and at night,\r\nAnd doth impeach the freedome of the state\r\nIf they deny him iustice. Twenty Merchants,\r\nThe Duke himselfe, and the Magnificoes\r\nOf greatest port haue all perswaded with him,\r\nBut none can driue him from the enuious plea\r\nOf forfeiture, of iustice, and his bond\r\n\r\n   Iessi. When I was with him, I haue heard him sweare\r\nTo Tuball and to Chus, his Countri-men,\r\nThat he would rather haue Anthonio's flesh,\r\nThen twenty times the value of the summe\r\nThat he did owe him: and I know my Lord,\r\nIf law, authoritie, and power denie not,\r\nIt will goe hard with poore Anthonio\r\n\r\n   Por. Is it your deere friend that is thus in trouble?\r\n  Bass. The deerest friend to me, the kindest man,\r\nThe best condition'd, and vnwearied spirit\r\nIn doing curtesies: and one in whom\r\nThe ancient Romane honour more appeares\r\nThen any that drawes breath in Italie\r\n\r\n   Por. What summe owes he the Iew?\r\n  Bass. For me three thousand ducats\r\n\r\n   Por. What, no more?\r\nPay him sixe thousand, and deface the bond:\r\nDouble sixe thousand, and then treble that,\r\nBefore a friend of this description\r\nShall lose a haire through Bassanio's fault.\r\nFirst goe with me to Church, and call me wife,\r\nAnd then away to Venice to your friend:\r\nFor neuer shall you lie by Portias side\r\nWith an vnquiet soule. You shall haue gold\r\nTo pay the petty debt twenty times ouer.\r\nWhen it is payd, bring your true friend along,\r\nMy maid Nerrissa, and my selfe meane time\r\nWill liue as maids and widdowes; come away,\r\nFor you shall hence vpon your wedding day:\r\nBid your friends welcome, show a merry cheere,\r\nSince you are deere bought, I will loue you deere.\r\nBut let me heare the letter of your friend.\r\nSweet Bassanio, my ships haue all miscarried, my Creditors\r\ngrow cruell, my estate is very low, my bond to the Iew is\r\nforfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should liue, all\r\ndebts are cleerd between you and I, if I might see you at my\r\ndeath: notwithstanding, vse your pleasure, if your loue doe not\r\nperswade you to come, let not my letter\r\n\r\n   Por. O loue! dispach all busines and be gone\r\n\r\n   Bass. Since I haue your good leaue to goe away,\r\nI will make hast; but till I come againe,\r\nNo bed shall ere be guilty of my stay,\r\nNor rest be interposer twixt vs twaine.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nEnter the Iew, and Solanio, and Anthonio, and the Iaylor.\r\n\r\n  Iew. Iaylor, looke to him, tell not me of mercy,\r\nThis is the foole that lends out money gratis.\r\nIaylor, looke to him\r\n\r\n   Ant. Heare me yet good Shylok\r\n\r\n   Iew. Ile haue my bond, speake not against my bond,\r\nI haue sworne an oath that I will haue my bond:\r\nThou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,\r\nBut since I am a dog, beware my phangs,\r\nThe Duke shall grant me iustice, I do wonder\r\nThou naughty Iaylor, that thou art so fond\r\nTo come abroad with him at his request\r\n\r\n   Ant. I pray thee heare me speake\r\n\r\n   Iew. Ile haue my bond, I will not heare thee speake,\r\nIle haue my bond, and therefore speake no more,\r\nIle not be made a soft and dull ey'd foole,\r\nTo shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yeeld\r\nTo Christian intercessors: follow not,\r\nIle haue no speaking, I will haue my bond.\r\n\r\nExit Iew.\r\n\r\n  Sol. It is the most impenetrable curre\r\nThat euer kept with men\r\n\r\n   Ant. Let him alone,\r\nIle follow him no more with bootlesse prayers:\r\nHe seekes my life, his reason well I know;\r\nI oft deliuer'd from his forfeitures\r\nMany that haue at times made mone to me,\r\nTherefore he hates me\r\n\r\n   Sol. I am sure the Duke will neuer grant\r\nthis forfeiture to hold\r\n\r\n   An. The Duke cannot deny the course of law:\r\nFor the commoditie that strangers haue\r\nWith vs in Venice, if it be denied,\r\nWill much impeach the iustice of the State,\r\nSince that the trade and profit of the citty\r\nConsisteth of all Nations. Therefore goe,\r\nThese greefes and losses haue so bated mee,\r\nThat I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh\r\nTo morrow, to my bloudy Creditor.\r\nWell Iaylor, on, pray God Bassanio come\r\nTo see me pay his debt, and then I care not.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nEnter Portia, Nerrissa, Lorenzo, Iessica, and a man of Portias.\r\n\r\n  Lor. Madam, although I speake it in your presence,\r\nYou haue a noble and a true conceit\r\nOf god-like amity, which appeares most strongly\r\nIn bearing thus the absence of your Lord.\r\nBut if you knew to whom you shew this honour,\r\nHow true a Gentleman you send releefe,\r\nHow deere a louer of my Lord your husband,\r\nI know you would be prouder of the worke\r\nThen customary bounty can enforce you\r\n\r\n   Por. I neuer did repent for doing good,\r\nNor shall not now: for in companions\r\nThat do conuerse and waste the time together,\r\nWhose soules doe beare an egal yoke of loue.\r\nThere must be needs a like proportion\r\nOf lyniaments, of manners, and of spirit;\r\nWhich makes me thinke that this Anthonio\r\nBeing the bosome louer of my Lord,\r\nMust needs be like my Lord. If it be so,\r\nHow little is the cost I haue bestowed\r\nIn purchasing the semblance of my soule;\r\nFrom out the state of hellish cruelty,\r\nThis comes too neere the praising of my selfe,\r\nTherefore no more of it: heere other things\r\nLorenso I commit into your hands,\r\nThe husbandry and mannage of my house,\r\nVntill my Lords returne; for mine owne part\r\nI haue toward heauen breath'd a secret vow,\r\nTo liue in prayer and contemplation,\r\nOnely attended by Nerrissa heere,\r\nVntill her husband and my Lords returne:\r\nThere is a monastery too miles off,\r\nAnd there we will abide. I doe desire you\r\nNot to denie this imposition,\r\nThe which my loue and some necessity\r\nNow layes vpon you\r\n\r\n   Lorens. Madame, with all my heart,\r\nI shall obey you in all faire commands\r\n\r\n   Por. My people doe already know my minde,\r\nAnd will acknowledge you and Iessica\r\nIn place of Lord Bassanio and my selfe.\r\nSo far you well till we shall meete againe\r\n\r\n   Lor. Faire thoughts & happy houres attend on you\r\n\r\n   Iessi. I wish your Ladiship all hearts content\r\n\r\n   Por. I thanke you for your wish, and am well pleas'd\r\nTo wish it backe on you: faryouwell Iessica.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nNow Balthaser, as I haue euer found thee honest true,\r\nSo let me finde thee still: take this same letter,\r\nAnd vse thou all the indeauor of a man,\r\nIn speed to Mantua, see thou render this\r\nInto my cosins hand, Doctor Belario,\r\nAnd looke what notes and garments he doth giue thee,\r\nBring them I pray thee with imagin'd speed\r\nVnto the Tranect, to the common Ferrie\r\nWhich trades to Venice; waste no time in words,\r\nBut get thee gone, I shall be there before thee\r\n\r\n   Balth. Madam, I goe with all conuenient speed\r\n\r\n   Por. Come on Nerissa, I haue worke in hand\r\nThat you yet know not of; wee'll see our husbands\r\nBefore they thinke of vs?\r\n  Nerrissa. Shall they see vs?\r\n  Portia. They shall Nerrissa: but in such a habit,\r\nThat they shall thinke we are accomplished\r\nWith that we lacke; Ile hold thee any wager\r\nWhen we are both accoutered like yong men,\r\nIle proue the prettier fellow of the two,\r\nAnd weare my dagger with the brauer grace,\r\nAnd speake betweene the change of man and boy,\r\nWith a reede voyce, and turne two minsing steps\r\nInto a manly stride; and speake of frayes\r\nLike a fine bragging youth: and tell quaint lyes\r\nHow honourable Ladies sought my loue,\r\nWhich I denying, they fell sicke and died.\r\nI could not doe withall: then Ile repent,\r\nAnd wish for all that, that I had not kil'd them;\r\nAnd twentie of these punie lies Ile tell,\r\nThat men shall sweare I haue discontinued schoole\r\nAboue a twelue moneth: I haue within my minde\r\nA thousand raw tricks of these bragging Iacks,\r\nWhich I will practise\r\n\r\n   Nerris. Why, shall wee turne to men?\r\n  Portia. Fie, what a questions that?\r\nIf thou wert nere a lewd interpreter:\r\nBut come, Ile tell thee all my whole deuice\r\nWhen I am in my coach, which stayes for vs\r\nAt the Parke gate; and therefore haste away,\r\nFor we must measure twentie miles to day.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nEnter Clowne and Iessica.\r\n\r\n  Clown. Yes truly; for looke you, the sinnes of the Father\r\nare to be laid vpon the children, therefore I promise\r\nyou, I feare you, I was alwaies plaine with you, and so\r\nnow I speake my agitation of the matter: therfore be of\r\ngood cheere, for truly I thinke you are damn'd, there is\r\nbut one hope in it that can doe you anie good, and that is\r\nbut a kinde of bastard hope neither\r\n\r\n   Iessica. And what hope is that I pray thee?\r\n  Clow. Marrie you may partlie hope that your father\r\ngot you not, that you are not the Iewes daughter\r\n\r\n   Ies. That were a kinde of bastard hope indeed, so the\r\nsins of my mother should be visited vpon me\r\n\r\n   Clow. Truly then I feare you are damned both by father\r\nand mother: thus when I shun Scilla your father, I\r\nfall into Charibdis your mother; well, you are gone both\r\nwaies\r\n\r\n   Ies. I shall be sau'd by my husband, he hath made me\r\na Christian\r\n\r\n   Clow. Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians\r\nenow before, e'ne as many as could wel liue one by another:\r\nthis making of Christians will raise the price of\r\nHogs, if wee grow all to be porke-eaters, wee shall not\r\nshortlie haue a rasher on the coales for money.\r\nEnter Lorenzo.\r\n\r\n  Ies. Ile tell my husband Lancelet what you say, heere\r\nhe comes\r\n\r\n   Loren. I shall grow iealous of you shortly Lancelet,\r\nif you thus get my wife into corners?\r\n  Ies. Nay, you need not feare vs Lorenzo, Launcelet\r\nand I are out, he tells me flatly there is no mercy for mee\r\nin heauen, because I am a Iewes daughter: and hee saies\r\nyou are no good member of the common wealth, for\r\nin conuerting Iewes to Christians, you raise the price\r\nof Porke\r\n\r\n   Loren. I shall answere that better to the Commonwealth,\r\nthan you can the getting vp of the Negroes bellie:\r\nthe Moore is with childe by you Launcelet?\r\n  Clow. It is much that the Moore should be more then\r\nreason: but if she be lesse then an honest woman, shee is\r\nindeed more then I tooke her for\r\n\r\n   Loren. How euerie foole can play vpon the word, I\r\nthinke the best grace of witte will shortly turne into silence,\r\nand discourse grow commendable in none onely\r\nbut Parrats: goe in sirra, bid them prepare for dinner?\r\n  Clow. That is done sir, they haue all stomacks?\r\n  Loren. Goodly Lord, what a witte-snapper are you,\r\nthen bid them prepare dinner\r\n\r\n   Clow. That is done to sir, onely couer is the word\r\n\r\n   Loren. Will you couer than sir?\r\n  Clow. Not so sir neither, I know my dutie\r\n\r\n   Loren. Yet more quarreling with occasion, wilt thou\r\nshew the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant; I pray\r\nthee vnderstand a plaine man in his plaine meaning: goe\r\nto thy fellowes, bid them couer the table, serue in the\r\nmeat, and we will come in to dinner\r\n\r\n   Clow. For the table sir, it shall be seru'd in, for the\r\nmeat sir, it shall bee couered, for your comming in to\r\ndinner sir, why let it be as humors and conceits shall gouerne.\r\n\r\nExit Clowne.\r\n\r\n  Lor. O deare discretion, how his words are suted,\r\nThe foole hath planted in his memory\r\nAn Armie of good words, and I doe know\r\nA many fooles that stand in better place,\r\nGarnisht like him, that for a tricksie word\r\nDefie the matter: how cheer'st thou Iessica,\r\nAnd now good sweet say thy opinion,\r\nHow dost thou like the Lord Bassiano's wife?\r\n  Iessi. Past all expressing, it is very meete\r\nThe Lord Bassanio liue an vpright life\r\nFor hauing such a blessing in his Lady,\r\nHe findes the ioyes of heauen heere on earth,\r\nAnd if on earth he doe not meane it, it\r\nIs reason he should neuer come to heauen?\r\nWhy, if two gods should play some heauenly match,\r\nAnd on the wager lay two earthly women,\r\nAnd Portia one: there must be something else\r\nPaund with the other, for the poore rude world\r\nHath not her fellow\r\n\r\n   Loren. Euen such a husband\r\nHast thou of me, as she is for a wife\r\n\r\n   Ies. Nay, but aske my opinion to of that?\r\n  Lor. I will anone, first let vs goe to dinner?\r\n  Ies. Nay, let me praise you while I haue a stomacke?\r\n  Lor. No pray thee, let it serue for table talke,\r\nThen how som ere thou speakst 'mong other things,\r\nI shall digest it?\r\n  Iessi. Well, Ile set you forth.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nActus Quartus.\r\n\r\nEnter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Anthonio, Bassanio, and\r\nGratiano\r\n\r\n   Duke. What, is Anthonio heere?\r\n  Ant. Ready, so please your grace?\r\n  Duke. I am sorry for thee, thou art come to answere\r\nA stonie aduersary, an inhumane wretch,\r\nVncapable of pitty, voyd, and empty\r\nFrom any dram of mercie\r\n\r\n   Ant. I haue heard\r\nYour Grace hath tane great paines to qualifie\r\nHis rigorous course: but since he stands obdurate,\r\nAnd that no lawful meanes can carrie me\r\nOut of his enuies reach, I do oppose\r\nMy patience to his fury, and am arm'd\r\nTo suffer with a quietnesse of spirit,\r\nThe very tiranny and rage of his\r\n\r\n   Du. Go one and cal the Iew into the Court\r\n\r\n   Sal. He is ready at the doore, he comes my Lord.\r\nEnter Shylocke.\r\n\r\n  Du. Make roome, and let him stand before our face.\r\nShylocke the world thinkes, and I thinke so to\r\nThat thou but leadest this fashion of thy mallice\r\nTo the last houre of act, and then 'tis thought\r\nThou'lt shew thy mercy and remorse more strange,\r\nThan is thy strange apparant cruelty;\r\nAnd where thou now exact'st the penalty,\r\nWhich is a pound of this poore Merchants flesh,\r\nThou wilt not onely loose the forfeiture,\r\nBut touch'd with humane gentlenesse and loue:\r\nForgiue a moytie of the principall,\r\nGlancing an eye of pitty on his losses\r\nThat haue of late so hudled on his backe,\r\nEnow to presse a royall Merchant downe;\r\nAnd plucke commiseration of his state\r\nFrom brassie bosomes, and rough hearts of flints,\r\nFrom stubborne Turkes and Tarters neuer traind\r\nTo offices of tender curtesie,\r\nWe all expect a gentle answer Iew?\r\n  Iew. I haue possest your grace of what I purpose,\r\nAnd by our holy Sabbath haue I sworne\r\nTo haue the due and forfeit of my bond.\r\nIf you denie it, let the danger light\r\nVpon your Charter, and your Cities freedome.\r\nYou'l aske me why I rather choose to haue\r\nA weight of carrion flesh, then to receiue\r\nThree thousand Ducats? Ile not answer that:\r\nBut say it is my humor; Is it answered?\r\nWhat if my house be troubled with a Rat,\r\nAnd I be pleas'd to giue ten thousand Ducates\r\nTo haue it bain'd? What, are you answer'd yet?\r\nSome men there are loue not a gaping Pigge:\r\nSome that are mad, if they behold a Cat:\r\nAnd others, when the bag-pipe sings i'th nose,\r\nCannot containe their Vrine for affection.\r\nMasters of passion swayes it to the moode\r\nOf what it likes or loaths, now for your answer:\r\nAs there is no firme reason to be rendred\r\nWhy he cannot abide a gaping Pigge?\r\nWhy he a harmlesse necessarie Cat?\r\nWhy he a woollen bag-pipe: but of force\r\nMust yeeld to such ineuitable shame,\r\nAs to offend himselfe being offended:\r\nSo can I giue no reason, nor I will not,\r\nMore then a lodg'd hate, and a certaine loathing\r\nI beare Anthonio, that I follow thus\r\nA loosing suite against him? Are you answered?\r\n  Bass. This is no answer thou vnfeeling man,\r\nTo excuse the currant of thy cruelty\r\n\r\n   Iew. I am not bound to please thee with my answer\r\n\r\n   Bass. Do all men kil the things they do not loue?\r\n  Iew. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?\r\n  Bass. Euerie offence is not a hate at first\r\n\r\n   Iew. What wouldst thou haue a Serpent sting thee\r\ntwice?\r\n  Ant. I pray you thinke you question with the Iew:\r\nYou may as well go stand vpon the beach,\r\nAnd bid the maine flood baite his vsuall height,\r\nOr euen as well vse question with the Wolfe,\r\nThe Ewe bleate for the Lambe:\r\nYou may as well forbid the Mountaine Pines\r\nTo wagge their high tops, and to make no noise\r\nWhen they are fretted with the gusts of heauen:\r\nYou may as well do any thing most hard,\r\nAs seeke to soften that, then which what harder?\r\nHis Iewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you\r\nMake no more offers, vse no farther meanes,\r\nBut with all briefe and plaine conueniencie\r\nLet me haue iudgement, and the Iew his will\r\n\r\n   Bas. For thy three thousand Ducates heere is six\r\n\r\n   Iew. If euerie Ducat in sixe thousand Ducates\r\nWere in sixe parts, and euery part a Ducate,\r\nI would not draw them, I would haue my bond?\r\n  Du. How shalt thou hope for mercie, rendring none?\r\n  Iew. What iudgement shall I dread doing no wrong?\r\nYou haue among you many a purchast slaue,\r\nWhich like your Asses, and your Dogs and Mules,\r\nYou vse in abiect and in slauish parts,\r\nBecause you bought them. Shall I say to you,\r\nLet them be free, marrie them to your heires?\r\nWhy sweate they vnder burthens? Let their beds\r\nBe made as soft as yours: and let their pallats\r\nBe season'd with such Viands: you will answer\r\nThe slaues are ours. So do I answer you.\r\nThe pound of flesh which I demand of him\r\nIs deerely bought, 'tis mine, and I will haue it.\r\nIf you deny me; fie vpon your Law,\r\nThere is no force in the decrees of Venice;\r\nI stand for iudgement, answer, Shall I haue it?\r\n  Du. Vpon my power I may dismisse this Court,\r\nVnlesse Bellario a learned Doctor,\r\nWhom I haue sent for to determine this,\r\nCome heere to day\r\n\r\n   Sal. My Lord, heere stayes without\r\nA Messenger with Letters from the Doctor,\r\nNew come from Padua\r\n\r\n   Du. Bring vs the Letters, Call the Messengers\r\n\r\n   Bass. Good cheere Anthonio. What man, corage yet:\r\nThe Iew shall haue my flesh, blood, bones, and all,\r\nEre thou shalt loose for me one drop of blood\r\n\r\n   Ant. I am a tainted Weather of the flocke,\r\nMeetest for death, the weakest kinde of fruite\r\nDrops earliest to the ground, and so let me;\r\nYou cannot better be employ'd Bassanio,\r\nThen to liue still, and write mine Epitaph.\r\nEnter Nerrissa.\r\n\r\n  Du. Came you from Padua from Bellario?\r\n  Ner. From both.\r\nMy Lord Bellario greets your Grace\r\n\r\n   Bas. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\r\n  Iew. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there\r\n\r\n   Gra. Not on thy soale: but on thy soule harsh Iew\r\nThou mak'st thy knife keene: but no mettall can,\r\nNo, not the hangmans Axe beare halfe the keennesse\r\nOf thy sharpe enuy. Can no prayers pierce thee?\r\n  Iew. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make\r\n\r\n   Gra. O be thou damn'd, inexecrable dogge,\r\nAnd for thy life let iustice be accus'd:\r\nThou almost mak'st me wauer in my faith;\r\nTo hold opinion with Pythagoras,\r\nThat soules of Animals infuse themselues\r\nInto the trunkes of men. Thy currish spirit\r\nGouern'd a Wolfe, who hang'd for humane slaughter,\r\nEuen from the gallowes did his fell soule fleet;\r\nAnd whil'st thou layest in thy vnhallowed dam,\r\nInfus'd it selfe in thee: For thy desires\r\nAre Woluish, bloody, steru'd, and rauenous\r\n\r\n   Iew. Till thou canst raile the seale from off my bond\r\nThou but offend'st thy Lungs to speake so loud:\r\nRepaire thy wit good youth, or it will fall\r\nTo endlesse ruine. I stand heere for Law\r\n\r\n   Du. This Letter from Bellario doth commend\r\nA yong and Learned Doctor in our Court;\r\nWhere is he?\r\n  Ner. He attendeth heere hard by\r\nTo know your answer, whether you'l admit him\r\n\r\n   Du. With all my heart. Some three or four of you\r\nGo giue him curteous conduct to this place,\r\nMeane time the Court shall heare Bellarioes Letter.\r\nYour Grace shall vnderstand, that at the receite of your\r\nLetter I am very sicke: but in the instant that your messenger\r\ncame, in louing visitation, was with me a yong Doctor\r\nof Rome, his name is Balthasar: I acquainted him with\r\nthe cause in Controuersie, betweene the Iew and Anthonio\r\nthe Merchant: We turn'd ore many Bookes together: hee is\r\nfurnished with my opinion, which bettred with his owne learning,\r\nthe greatnesse whereof I cannot enough commend, comes\r\nwith him at my importunity, to fill vp your Graces request in\r\nmy sted. I beseech you, let his lacke of years be no impediment\r\nto let him lacke a reuerend estimation: for I neuer knewe so\r\nyong a body, with so old a head. I leaue him to your gracious\r\nacceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.\r\nEnter Portia for Balthazar.\r\n\r\n  Duke. You heare the learn'd Bellario what he writes,\r\nAnd heere (I take it) is the Doctor come.\r\nGiue me your hand: Came you from old Bellario?\r\n  Por. I did my Lord\r\n\r\n   Du. You are welcome: take your place;\r\nAre you acquainted with the difference\r\nThat holds this present question in the Court\r\n\r\n   Por. I am enformed throughly of the cause.\r\nWhich is the Merchant heere? and which the Iew?\r\n  Du. Anthonio and old Shylocke, both stand forth\r\n\r\n   Por. Is your name Shylocke?\r\n  Iew. Shylocke is my name\r\n\r\n   Por. Of a strange nature is the sute you follow,\r\nYet in such rule, that the Venetian Law\r\nCannot impugne you as you do proceed.\r\nYou stand within his danger, do you not?\r\n  Ant. I, so he sayes\r\n\r\n   Por. Do you confesse the bond?\r\n  Ant. I do\r\n\r\n   Por. Then must the Iew be mercifull\r\n\r\n   Iew. On what compulsion must I ? Tell me that\r\n\r\n   Por. The quality of mercy is not strain'd,\r\nIt droppeth as the gentle raine from heauen\r\nVpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,\r\nIt blesseth him that giues, and him that takes,\r\n'Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes\r\nThe throned Monarch better then his Crowne.\r\nHis Scepter shewes the force of temporall power,\r\nThe attribute to awe and Maiestie,\r\nWherein doth sit the dread and feare of Kings:\r\nBut mercy is aboue this sceptred sway,\r\nIt is enthroned in the hearts of Kings,\r\nIt is an attribute to God himselfe;\r\nAnd earthly power doth then shew likest Gods\r\nWhen mercie seasons Iustice. Therefore Iew,\r\nThough Iustice be thy plea, consider this,\r\nThat in the course of Iustice, none of vs\r\nShould see saluation: we do pray for mercie,\r\nAnd that same prayer, doth teach vs all to render\r\nThe deeds of mercie. I haue spoke thus much\r\nTo mittigate the iustice of thy plea:\r\nWhich if thou follow, this strict course of Venice\r\nMust needes giue sentence 'gainst the Merchant there\r\n\r\n   Shy. My deeds vpon my head, I craue the Law,\r\nThe penaltie and forfeite of my bond\r\n\r\n   Por. Is he not able to discharge the money?\r\n  Bas. Yes, heere I tender it for him in the Court,\r\nYea, twice the summe, if that will not suffice,\r\nI will be bound to pay it ten times ore,\r\nOn forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:\r\nIf this will not suffice, it must appeare\r\nThat malice beares downe truth. And I beseech you\r\nWrest once the Law to your authority.\r\nTo do a great right, do a little wrong,\r\nAnd curbe this cruell diuell of his will\r\n\r\n   Por. It must not be, there is no power in Venice\r\nCan alter a decree established:\r\n'Twill be recorded for a President,\r\nAnd many an error by the same example,\r\nWill rush into the state: It cannot be\r\n\r\n   Iew. A Daniel come to iudgement, yea a Daniel.\r\nO wise young Iudge, how do I honour thee\r\n\r\n   Por. I pray you let me looke vpon the bond\r\n\r\n   Iew. Heere 'tis most reuerend Doctor, heere it is\r\n\r\n   Por. Shylocke, there's thrice thy monie offered thee\r\n\r\n   Shy. An oath, an oath, I haue an oath in heauen:\r\nShall I lay periurie vpon my soule?\r\nNo not for Venice\r\n\r\n   Por. Why this bond is forfeit,\r\nAnd lawfully by this the Iew may claime\r\nA pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\r\nNeerest the Merchants heart; be mercifull,\r\nTake thrice thy money, bid me teare the bond\r\n\r\n   Iew. When it is paid according to the tenure.\r\nIt doth appeare you are a worthy Iudge:\r\nYou know the Law, your exposition\r\nHath beene most sound. I charge you by the Law,\r\nWhereof you are a well-deseruing pillar,\r\nProceede to iudgement: By my soule I sweare,\r\nThere is no power in the tongue of man\r\nTo alter me: I stay heere on my bond\r\n\r\n   An. Most heartily I do beseech the Court\r\nTo giue the iudgement\r\n\r\n   Por. Why then thus it is:\r\nYou must prepare your bosome for his knife\r\n\r\n   Iew. O noble Iudge, O excellent yong man\r\n\r\n   Por. For the intent and purpose of the Law\r\nHath full relation to the penaltie,\r\nWhich heere appeareth due vpon the bond\r\n\r\n   Iew. 'Tis verie true: O wise and vpright Iudge,\r\nHow much more elder art thou then thy lookes?\r\n  Por. Therefore lay bare your bosome\r\n\r\n   Iew. I, his brest,\r\nSo sayes the bond, doth it not noble Iudge?\r\nNeerest his heart, those are the very words\r\n\r\n   Por. It is so: Are there ballance heere to weigh the\r\nflesh?\r\n  Iew. I haue them ready\r\n\r\n   Por. Haue by some Surgeon Shylock on your charge\r\nTo stop his wounds, least he should bleede to death\r\n\r\n   Iew. It is not nominated in the bond?\r\n  Por. It is not so exprest: but what of that?\r\n'Twere good you do so much for charitie\r\n\r\n   Iew. I cannot finde it, 'tis not in the bond\r\n\r\n   Por. Come Merchant, haue you any thing to say?\r\n  Ant. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.\r\nGiue me your hand Bassanio, fare you well.\r\nGreeue not that I am falne to this for you:\r\nFor heerein fortune shewes her selfe more kinde\r\nThen is her custome. It is still her vse\r\nTo let the wretched man out-liue his wealth,\r\nTo view with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow\r\nAn age of pouerty. From which lingring penance\r\nOf such miserie, doth she cut me off:\r\nCommend me to your honourable Wife,\r\nTell her the processe of Anthonio's end:\r\nSay how I lou'd you; speake me faire in death:\r\nAnd when the tale is told, bid her be iudge,\r\nWhether Bassanio had not once a Loue:\r\nRepent not you that you shall loose your friend,\r\nAnd he repents not that he payes your debt.\r\nFor if the Iew do cut but deepe enough,\r\nIle pay it instantly, with all my heart\r\n\r\n   Bas. Anthonio, I am married to a wife,\r\nWhich is as deere to me as life it selfe,\r\nBut life it selfe, my wife, and all the world,\r\nAre not with me esteem'd aboue thy life.\r\nI would loose all, I sacrifice them all\r\nHeere to this deuill, to deliuer you\r\n\r\n   Por. Your wife would giue you little thanks for that\r\nIf she were by to heare you make the offer\r\n\r\n   Gra. I haue a wife whom I protest I loue,\r\nI would she were in heauen, so she could\r\nIntreat some power to change this currish Iew\r\n\r\n   Ner. 'Tis well you offer it behinde her backe,\r\nThe wish would make else an vnquiet house\r\n\r\n   Iew. These be the Christian husbands: I haue a daughter\r\nWould any of the stocke of Barrabas\r\nHad beene her husband, rather then a Christian.\r\nWe trifle time, I pray thee pursue sentence\r\n\r\n   Por. A pound of that same marchants flesh is thine,\r\nThe Court awards it, and the law doth giue it\r\n\r\n   Iew. Most rightfull Iudge\r\n\r\n   Por. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast,\r\nThe Law allowes it, and the Court awards it\r\n\r\n   Iew. Most learned Iudge, a sentence, come prepare\r\n\r\n   Por. Tarry a little, there is something else,\r\nThis bond doth giue thee heere no iot of bloud,\r\nThe words expresly are a pound of flesh:\r\nThen take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,\r\nBut in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\r\nOne drop of Christian bloud, thy lands and goods\r\nAre by the Lawes of Venice confiscate\r\nVnto the state of Venice\r\n\r\n   Gra. O vpright Iudge,\r\nMarke Iew, o learned Iudge\r\n\r\n   Shy. Is that the law?\r\n  Por. Thy selfe shalt see the Act:\r\nFor as thou vrgest iustice, be assur'd\r\nThou shalt haue iustice more then thou desirest\r\n\r\n   Gra. O learned Iudge, mark Iew, a learned Iudge\r\n\r\n   Iew. I take this offer then, pay the bond thrice,\r\nAnd let the Christian goe\r\n\r\n   Bass. Heere is the money\r\n\r\n   Por. Soft, the Iew shall haue all iustice, soft, no haste,\r\nHe shall haue nothing but the penalty\r\n\r\n   Gra. O Iew, an vpright Iudge, a learned Iudge\r\n\r\n   Por. Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh,\r\nShed thou no bloud, nor cut thou lesse nor more\r\nBut iust a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more\r\nOr lesse then a iust pound, be it so much\r\nAs makes it light or heauy in the substance,\r\nOr the deuision of the twentieth part\r\nOf one poore scruple, nay if the scale doe turne\r\nBut in the estimation of a hayre,\r\nThou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate\r\n\r\n   Gra. A second Daniel, a Daniel Iew,\r\nNow infidell I haue thee on the hip\r\n\r\n   Por. Why doth the Iew pause, take thy forfeiture\r\n\r\n   Shy. Giue me my principall, and let me goe\r\n\r\n   Bass. I haue it ready for thee, heere it is\r\n\r\n   Por. He hath refus'd it in the open Court,\r\nHe shall haue meerly iustice and his bond\r\n\r\n   Gra. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel,\r\nI thanke thee Iew for teaching me that word\r\n\r\n   Shy. Shall I not haue barely my principall?\r\n  Por. Thou shalt haue nothing but the forfeiture,\r\nTo be taken so at thy perill Iew\r\n\r\n   Shy. Why then the Deuill giue him good of it:\r\nIle stay no longer question\r\n\r\n   Por. Tarry Iew,\r\nThe Law hath yet another hold on you.\r\nIt is enacted in the Lawes of Venice,\r\nIf it be proued against an Alien,\r\nThat by direct, or indirect attempts\r\nHe seeke the life of any Citizen,\r\nThe party gainst the which he doth contriue,\r\nShall seaze one halfe his goods, the other halfe\r\nComes to the priuie coffer of the State,\r\nAnd the offenders life lies in the mercy\r\nOf the Duke onely, gainst all other voice.\r\nIn which predicament I say thou standst:\r\nFor it appeares by manifest proceeding,\r\nThat indirectly, and directly to,\r\nThou hast contriu'd against the very life\r\nOf the defendant: and thou hast incur'd\r\nThe danger formerly by me rehearst.\r\nDowne therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke\r\n\r\n   Gra. Beg that thou maist haue leaue to hang thy selfe,\r\nAnd yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state,\r\nThou hast not left the value of a cord,\r\nTherefore thou must be hang'd at the states charge\r\n\r\n   Duk. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,\r\nI pardon thee thy life before thou aske it:\r\nFor halfe thy wealth, it is Anthonio's\r\nThe other halfe comes to the generall state,\r\nWhich humblenesse may driue vnto a fine\r\n\r\n   Por. I for the state, not for Anthonio\r\n\r\n   Shy. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that,\r\nYou take my house, when you do take the prop\r\nThat doth sustaine my house: you take my life\r\nWhen you doe take the meanes whereby I liue\r\n\r\n   Por. What mercy can you render him Anthonio?\r\n  Gra. A halter gratis, nothing else for Gods sake\r\n\r\n   Ant. So please my Lord the Duke, and all the Court\r\nTo quit the fine for one halfe of his goods,\r\nI am content: so he will let me haue\r\nThe other halfe in vse, to render it\r\nVpon his death, vnto the Gentleman\r\nThat lately stole his daughter.\r\nTwo things prouided more, that for this fauour\r\nHe presently become a Christian:\r\nThe other, that he doe record a gift\r\nHeere in the Court of all he dies possest\r\nVnto his sonne Lorenzo, and his daughter\r\n\r\n   Duk. He shall doe this, or else I doe recant\r\nThe pardon that I late pronounced heere\r\n\r\n   Por. Art thou contented Iew? what dost thou say?\r\n  Shy. I am content\r\n\r\n   Por. Clarke, draw a deed of gift\r\n\r\n   Shy. I pray you giue me leaue to goe from hence,\r\nI am not well, send the deed after me,\r\nAnd I will signe it\r\n\r\n   Duke. Get thee gone, but doe it\r\n\r\n   Gra. In christning thou shalt haue two godfathers,\r\nHad I been iudge, thou shouldst haue had ten more,\r\nTo bring thee to the gallowes, not to the font.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Du. Sir I intreat you with me home to dinner\r\n\r\n   Por. I humbly doe desire your Grace of pardon,\r\nI must away this night toward Padua,\r\nAnd it is meete I presently set forth\r\n\r\n   Duk. I am sorry that your leysure serues you not:\r\nAnthonio, gratifie this gentleman,\r\nFor in my minde you are much bound to him.\r\n\r\nExit Duke and his traine.\r\n\r\n  Bass. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend\r\nHaue by your wisedome beene this day acquitted\r\nOf greeuous penalties, in lieu whereof,\r\nThree thousand Ducats due vnto the Iew\r\nWe freely cope your curteous paines withall\r\n\r\n   An. And stand indebted ouer and aboue\r\nIn loue and seruice to you euermore\r\n\r\n   Por. He is well paid that is well satisfied,\r\nAnd I deliuering you, am satisfied,\r\nAnd therein doe account my selfe well paid,\r\nMy minde was neuer yet more mercinarie.\r\nI pray you know me when we meete againe,\r\nI wish you well, and so I take my leaue\r\n\r\n   Bass. Deare sir, of force I must attempt you further,\r\nTake some remembrance of vs as a tribute,\r\nNot as fee: grant me two things, I pray you\r\nNot to denie me, and to pardon me\r\n\r\n   Por. You presse mee farre, and therefore I will yeeld,\r\nGiue me your gloues, Ile weare them for your sake,\r\nAnd for your loue Ile take this ring from you,\r\nDoe not draw backe your hand, ile take no more,\r\nAnd you in loue shall not deny me this?\r\n  Bass. This ring good sir, alas it is a trifle,\r\nI will not shame my selfe to giue you this\r\n\r\n   Por. I wil haue nothing else but onely this,\r\nAnd now methinkes I haue a minde to it\r\n\r\n   Bas. There's more depends on this then on the valew,\r\nThe dearest ring in Venice will I giue you,\r\nAnd finde it out by proclamation,\r\nOnely for this I pray you pardon me\r\n\r\n   Por. I see sir you are liberall in offers,\r\nYou taught me first to beg, and now me thinkes\r\nYou teach me how a beggar should be answer'd\r\n\r\n   Bas. Good sir, this ring was giuen me by my wife,\r\nAnd when she put it on, she made me vow\r\nThat I should neither sell, nor giue, nor lose it\r\n\r\n   Por. That scuse serues many men to saue their gifts,\r\nAnd if your wife be not a mad woman,\r\nAnd know how well I haue deseru'd this ring,\r\nShee would not hold out enemy for euer\r\nFor giuing it to me: well, peace be with you.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n  Ant. My L[ord]. Bassanio, let him haue the ring,\r\nLet his deseruings and my loue withall\r\nBe valued against your wiues commandement\r\n\r\n   Bass. Goe Gratiano, run and ouer-take him,\r\nGiue him the ring, and bring him if thou canst\r\nVnto Anthonios house, away, make haste.\r\n\r\nExit Grati.\r\n\r\nCome, you and I will thither presently,\r\nAnd in the morning early will we both\r\nFlie toward Belmont, come Anthonio.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nEnter Portia and Nerrissa.\r\n\r\n  Por. Enquire the Iewes house out, giue him this deed,\r\nAnd let him signe it, wee'll away to night,\r\nAnd be a day before our husbands home:\r\nThis deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.\r\nEnter Gratiano.\r\n\r\n  Gra. Faire sir, you are well ore-tane:\r\nMy L[ord]. Bassanio vpon more aduice,\r\nHath sent you heere this ring, and doth intreat\r\nYour company at dinner\r\n\r\n   Por. That cannot be;\r\nHis ring I doe accept most thankfully,\r\nAnd so I pray you tell him: furthermore,\r\nI pray you shew my youth old Shylockes house\r\n\r\n   Gra. That will I doe\r\n\r\n   Ner. Sir, I would speake with you:\r\nIle see if I can get my husbands ring\r\nWhich I did make him sweare to keepe for euer\r\n\r\n   Por. Thou maist I warrant, we shal haue old swearing\r\nThat they did giue the rings away to men;\r\nBut weele out-face them, and out-sweare them to:\r\nAway, make haste, thou know'st where I will tarry\r\n\r\n   Ner. Come good sir, will you shew me to this house.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nActus Quintus.\r\n\r\nEnter Lorenzo and Iessica.\r\n\r\n  Lor. The moone shines bright. In such a night as this,\r\nWhen the sweet winde did gently kisse the trees,\r\nAnd they did make no noyse, in such a night\r\nTroylus me thinkes mounted the Troian walls,\r\nAnd sigh'd his soule toward the Grecian tents\r\nWhere Cressed lay that night\r\n\r\n   Ies. In such a night\r\nDid Thisbie fearefully ore-trip the dewe,\r\nAnd saw the Lyons shadow ere himselfe,\r\nAnd ranne dismayed away\r\n\r\n   Loren. In such a night\r\nStood Dido with a Willow in her hand\r\nVpon the wilde sea bankes, and waft her Loue\r\nTo come againe to Carthage\r\n\r\n   Ies. In such a night\r\nMedea gathered the inchanted hearbs\r\nThat did renew old Eson\r\n\r\n   Loren. In such a night\r\nDid Iessica steale from the wealthy Iewe,\r\nAnd with an Vnthrift Loue did runne from Venice,\r\nAs farre as Belmont\r\n\r\n   Ies. In such a night\r\nDid young Lorenzo sweare he lou'd her well,\r\nStealing her soule with many vowes of faith,\r\nAnd nere a true one\r\n\r\n   Loren. In such a night\r\nDid pretty Iessica (like a little shrow)\r\nSlander her Loue, and he forgaue it her\r\n\r\n   Iessi.

Let's in, and there expect their comming.\r\nAnd yet no matter: why should we goe in?\r\nMy friend Stephen, signifie pray you\r\nWithin the house, your Mistresse is at hand,\r\nAnd bring your musique foorth into the ayre.\r\nHow sweet the moone-light sleepes vpon this banke,\r\nHeere will we sit, and let the sounds of musicke\r\nCreepe in our eares soft stilnes, and the night\r\nBecome the tutches of sweet harmonie:\r\nSit Iessica, looke how the floore of heauen\r\nIs thicke inlayed with pattens of bright gold,\r\nThere's not the smallest orbe which thou beholdst\r\nBut in his motion like an Angell sings,\r\nStill quiring to the young eyed Cherubins;\r\nSuch harmonie is in immortall soules,\r\nBut whilst this muddy vesture of decay\r\nDoth grosly close in it, we cannot heare it:\r\nCome hoe, and wake Diana with a hymne,\r\nWith sweetest tutches pearce your Mistresse eare,\r\nAnd draw her home with musicke\r\n\r\n   Iessi. I am neuer merry when I heare sweet musique.\r\n\r\nPlay musicke.\r\n\r\n  Lor. The reason is, your spirits are attentiue:\r\nFor doe but note a wilde and wanton heard\r\nOr race of youthful and vnhandled colts,\r\nFetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,\r\nWhich is the hot condition of their bloud,\r\nIf they but heare perchance a trumpet sound,\r\nOr any ayre of musicke touch their eares,\r\nYou shall perceiue them make a mutuall stand,\r\nTheir sauage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze,\r\nBy the sweet power of musicke: therefore the Poet\r\nDid faine that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods.\r\nSince naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,\r\nBut musicke for time doth change his nature,\r\nThe man that hath no musicke in himselfe,\r\nNor is not moued with concord of sweet sounds,\r\nIs fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoyles,\r\nThe motions of his spirit are dull as night,\r\nAnd his affections darke as Erobus,\r\nLet no such man be trusted: marke the musicke.\r\nEnter Portia and Nerrissa.\r\n\r\n  Por. That light we see is burning in my hall:\r\nHow farre that little candell throwes his beames,\r\nSo shines a good deed in a naughty world\r\n\r\n   Ner. When the moone shone we did not see the candle?\r\n  Por. So doth the greater glory dim the lesse,\r\nA substitute shines brightly as a King\r\nVntill a King be by, and then his state\r\nEmpties it selfe, as doth an inland brooke\r\nInto the maine of waters: musique, harke.\r\n\r\nMusicke.\r\n\r\n  Ner. It is your musicke Madame of the house\r\n\r\n   Por. Nothing is good I see without respect,\r\nMethinkes it sounds much sweeter then by day?\r\n  Ner. Silence bestowes that vertue on it Madam\r\n\r\n   Por. The Crow doth sing as sweetly as the Larke\r\nWhen neither is attended: and I thinke\r\nThe Nightingale if she should sing by day\r\nWhen euery Goose is cackling, would be thought\r\nNo better a Musitian then the Wren?\r\nHow many things by season, season'd are\r\nTo their right praise, and true perfection:\r\nPeace, how the Moone sleepes with Endimion,\r\nAnd would not be awak'd.\r\n\r\nMusicke ceases.\r\n\r\n  Lor. That is the voice,\r\nOr I am much deceiu'd of Portia\r\n\r\n   Por. He knowes me as the blinde man knowes the\r\nCuckow by the bad voice?\r\n  Lor. Deere Lady welcome home?\r\n  Por. We haue bene praying for our husbands welfare\r\nWhich speed we hope the better for our words,\r\nAre they return'd?\r\n  Lor. Madam, they are not yet:\r\nBut there is come a Messenger before\r\nTo signifie their comming\r\n\r\n   Por. Go in Nerrissa,\r\nGiue order to my seruants, that they take\r\nNo note at all of our being absent hence,\r\nNor you Lorenzo, Iessica nor you.\r\n\r\nA Tucket sounds.\r\n\r\n  Lor. Your husband is at hand, I heare his Trumpet,\r\nWe are no tell-tales Madam, feare you not\r\n\r\n   Por. This night methinkes is but the daylight sicke,\r\nIt lookes a little paler, 'tis a day,\r\nSuch as the day is, when the Sun is hid.\r\nEnter Bassanio, Anthonio, Gratiano, and their Followers.\r\n\r\n  Bas. We should hold day with the Antipodes,\r\nIf you would walke in absence of the sunne\r\n\r\n   Por. Let me giue light, but let me not be light,\r\nFor a light wife doth make a heauie husband,\r\nAnd neuer be Bassanio so for me,\r\nBut God sort all: you are welcome home my Lord\r\n\r\n   Bass. I thanke you Madam, giue welcom to my friend\r\nThis is the man, this is Anthonio,\r\nTo whom I am so infinitely bound\r\n\r\n   Por. You should in all sence be much bound to him,\r\nFor as I heare he was much bound for you\r\n\r\n   Anth. No more then I am wel acquitted of\r\n\r\n   Por. Sir, you are verie welcome to our house:\r\nIt must appeare in other waies then words,\r\nTherefore I scant this breathing curtesie\r\n\r\n   Gra. By yonder Moone I sweare you do me wrong,\r\nInfaith I gaue it to the Iudges Clearke,\r\nWould he were gelt that had it for my part,\r\nSince you do take it Loue so much at hart\r\n\r\n   Por. A quarrel hoe alreadie, what's the matter?\r\n  Gra. About a hoope of Gold, a paltry Ring\r\nThat she did giue me, whose Poesie was\r\nFor all the world like Cutlers Poetry\r\nVpon a knife; Loue mee, and leaue mee not\r\n\r\n   Ner. What talke you of the Poesie or the valew:\r\nYou swore to me when I did giue it you,\r\nThat you would weare it til the houre of death,\r\nAnd that it should lye with you in your graue,\r\nThough not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,\r\nYou should haue beene respectiue and haue kept it.\r\nGaue it a Iudges Clearke: but wel I know\r\nThe Clearke wil nere weare haire on's face that had it\r\n\r\n   Gra. He wil, and if he liue to be a man\r\n\r\n   Nerrissa. I, if a Woman liue to be a man\r\n\r\n   Gra. Now by this hand I gaue it to a youth,\r\nA kinde of boy, a little scrubbed boy,\r\nNo higher then thy selfe, the Iudges Clearke,\r\nA prating boy that begg'd it as a Fee,\r\nI could not for my heart deny it him\r\n\r\n   Por. You were too blame, I must be plaine with you,\r\nTo part so slightly with your wiues first gift,\r\nA thing stucke on with oathes vpon your finger,\r\nAnd so riueted with faith vnto your flesh.\r\nI gaue my Loue a Ring, and made him sweare\r\nNeuer to part with it, and heere he stands:\r\nI dare be sworne for him, he would not leaue it,\r\nNor plucke it from his finger, for the wealth\r\nThat the world masters. Now in faith Gratiano,\r\nYou giue your wife too vnkinde a cause of greefe,\r\nAnd 'twere to me I should be mad at it\r\n\r\n   Bass. Why I were best to cut my left hand off,\r\nAnd sweare I lost the Ring defending it\r\n\r\n   Gra. My Lord Bassanio gaue his Ring away\r\nVnto the Iudge that beg'd it, and indeede\r\nDeseru'd it too: and then the Boy his Clearke\r\nThat tooke some paines in writing, he begg'd mine,\r\nAnd neyther man nor master would take ought\r\nBut the two Rings\r\n\r\n   Por. What Ring gaue you my Lord?\r\nNot that I hope which you receiu'd of me\r\n\r\n   Bass. If I could adde a lie vnto a fault,\r\nI would deny it: but you see my finger\r\nHath not the Ring vpon it, it is gone\r\n\r\n   Por. Euen so voide is your false heart of truth.\r\nBy heauen I wil nere come in your bed\r\nVntil I see the Ring\r\n\r\n   Ner. Nor I in yours, til I againe see mine\r\n\r\n   Bass. Sweet Portia,\r\nIf you did know to whom I gaue the Ring,\r\nIf you did know for whom I gaue the Ring,\r\nAnd would conceiue for what I gaue the Ring,\r\nAnd how vnwillingly I left the Ring,\r\nWhen nought would be accepted but the Ring,\r\nYou would abate the strength of your displeasure?\r\n  Por. If you had knowne the vertue of the Ring,\r\nOr halfe her worthinesse that gaue the Ring,\r\nOr your owne honour to containe the Ring,\r\nYou would not then haue parted with the Ring:\r\nWhat man is there so much vnreasonable,\r\nIf you had pleas'd to haue defended it\r\nWith any termes of Zeale: wanted the modestie\r\nTo vrge the thing held as a ceremonie:\r\nNerrissa teaches me what to beleeue,\r\nIle die for't, but some Woman had the Ring?\r\n  Bass. No by mine honor Madam, by my soule\r\nNo Woman had it, but a ciuill Doctor,\r\nWhich did refuse three thousand Ducates of me,\r\nAnd beg'd the Ring; the which I did denie him,\r\nAnd suffer'd him to go displeas'd away:\r\nEuen he that had held vp the verie life\r\nOf my deere friend. What should I say sweete Lady?\r\nI was inforc'd to send it after him,\r\nI was beset with shame and curtesie,\r\nMy honor would not let ingratitude\r\nSo much besmeare it. Pardon me good Lady,\r\nAnd by these blessed Candles of the night,\r\nHad you bene there, I thinke you would haue beg'd\r\nThe Ring of me, to giue the worthie Doctor?\r\n  Por. Let not that Doctor ere come neere my house,\r\nSince he hath got the iewell that I loued,\r\nAnd that which you did sweare to keepe for me,\r\nI will become as liberall as you,\r\nIle not deny him any thing I haue,\r\nNo, not my body, nor my husbands bed:\r\nKnow him I shall, I am well sure of it.\r\nLie not a night from home. Watch me like Argos,\r\nIf you doe not, if I be left alone,\r\nNow by mine honour which is yet mine owne,\r\nIle haue the Doctor for my bedfellow\r\n\r\n   Nerrissa. And I his Clarke: therefore be well aduis'd\r\nHow you doe leaue me to mine owne protection\r\n\r\n   Gra. Well, doe you so: let not me take him then,\r\nFor if I doe, ile mar the yong Clarks pen\r\n\r\n   Ant. I am th' vnhappy subiect of these quarrels\r\n\r\n   Por. Sir, grieue not you,\r\nYou are welcome notwithstanding\r\n\r\n   Bas. Portia, forgiue me this enforced wrong,\r\nAnd in the hearing of these manie friends\r\nI sweare to thee, euen by thine owne faire eyes\r\nWherein I see my selfe\r\n\r\n   Por. Marke you but that?\r\nIn both my eyes he doubly sees himselfe:\r\nIn each eye one, sweare by your double selfe,\r\nAnd there's an oath of credit\r\n\r\n   Bas. Nay, but heare me.\r\nPardon this fault, and by my soule I sweare\r\nI neuer more will breake an oath with thee\r\n\r\n   Anth. I once did lend my bodie for thy wealth,\r\nWhich but for him that had your husbands ring\r\nHad quite miscarried. I dare be bound againe,\r\nMy soule vpon the forfeit, that your Lord\r\nWill neuer more breake faith aduisedlie\r\n\r\n   Por. Then you shall be his suretie: giue him this,\r\nAnd bid him keepe it better then the other\r\n\r\n   Ant. Heere Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring\r\n\r\n   Bass. By heauen it is the same I gaue the Doctor\r\n\r\n   Por. I had it of him: pardon Bassanio,\r\nFor by this ring the Doctor lay with me\r\n\r\n   Ner. And pardon me my gentle Gratiano,\r\nFor that same scrubbed boy the Doctors Clarke\r\nIn liew of this, last night did lye with me\r\n\r\n   Gra. Why this is like the mending of high waies\r\nIn Sommer, where the waies are faire enough:\r\nWhat, are we Cuckolds ere we haue deseru'd it\r\n\r\n   Por. Speake not so grossely, you are all amaz'd;\r\nHeere is a letter, reade it at your leysure,\r\nIt comes from Padua from Bellario,\r\nThere you shall finde that Portia was the Doctor,\r\nNerrissa there her Clarke. Lorenzo heere\r\nShall witnesse I set forth as soone as you,\r\nAnd but eu'n now return'd: I haue not yet\r\nEntred my house. Anthonio you are welcome,\r\nAnd I haue better newes in store for you\r\nThen you expect: vnseale this letter soone,\r\nThere you shall finde three of your Argosies\r\nAre richly come to harbour sodainlie.\r\nYou shall not know by what strange accident\r\nI chanced on this letter\r\n\r\n   Antho. I am dumbe\r\n\r\n   Bass. Were you the Doctor, and I knew you not?\r\n  Gra. Were you the Clark that is to make me cuckold\r\n\r\n   Ner. I, but the Clark that neuer meanes to doe it,\r\nVnlesse he liue vntill he be a man\r\n\r\n   Bass. (Sweet Doctor) you shall be my bedfellow,\r\nWhen I am absent, then lie with my wife\r\n\r\n   An. (Sweet Ladie) you haue giuen me life & liuing;\r\nFor heere I reade for certaine that my ships\r\nAre safelie come to Rode\r\n\r\n   Por. How now Lorenzo?\r\nMy Clarke hath some good comforts to for you\r\n\r\n   Ner. I, and Ile giue them him without a fee.\r\nThere doe I giue to you and Iessica\r\nFrom the rich Iewe, a speciall deed of gift\r\nAfter his death, of all he dies possess'd of\r\n\r\n   Loren. Faire Ladies you drop Manna in the way\r\nOf starued people\r\n\r\n   Por. It is almost morning,\r\nAnd yet I am sure you are not satisfied\r\nOf these euents at full. Let vs goe in,\r\nAnd charge vs there vpon intergatories,\r\nAnd we will answer all things faithfully\r\n\r\n   Gra. Let it be so, the first intergatory\r\nThat my Nerrissa shall be sworne on, is,\r\nWhether till the next night she had rather stay,\r\nOr goe to bed, now being two houres to day,\r\nBut were the day come, I should wish it darke,\r\nTill I were couching with the Doctors Clarke.\r\nWell, while I liue, Ile feare no other thing\r\nSo sore, as keeping safe Nerrissas ring.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nFINIS.

Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.\r\n\r\n  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.\r\n\r\n  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.\r\n\r\n  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.\r\n\r\n  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.\r\n    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.\r\n\r\n  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take\r\n    the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.\r\n\r\n  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the\r\n    wall.\r\n\r\n  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,\r\n    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men\r\n    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.\r\n\r\n  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\r\n\r\n  Samp. 'Tis all one.

Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\r\n    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?\r\n\r\n  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary\r\n    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\r\n    I drew to part them. In the instant came\r\n    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;\r\n    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,\r\n    He swung about his head and cut the winds,\r\n    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.\r\n    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\r\n    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,\r\n    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.\r\n\r\n  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?\r\n    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun\r\n    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,\r\n    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\r\n    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore\r\n    That westward rooteth from the city's side,\r\n    So early walking did I see your son.\r\n    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me\r\n    And stole into the covert of the wood.\r\n    I- measuring his affections by my own,\r\n    Which then most sought where most might not be found,\r\n    Being one too many by my weary self-\r\n    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,\r\n    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.\r\n\r\n  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,\r\n    With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,\r\n    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\r\n    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun\r\n    Should in the furthest East bean to draw\r\n    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\r\n    Away from light steals home my heavy son\r\n    And private in his chamber pens himself,\r\n    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight\r\n    And makes himself an artificial night.\r\n    Black and portentous must this humour prove\r\n    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.\r\n\r\n  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?\r\n\r\n  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him\r\n\r\n  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?\r\n\r\n  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;\r\n    But he, his own affections' counsellor,\r\n    Is to himself- I will not say how true-\r\n    But to himself so secret and so close,\r\n    So far from sounding and discovery,\r\n    As is the bud bit with an envious worm\r\n    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\r\n    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\r\n    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\r\n    We would as willingly give cure as know.\r\n\r\n                       Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,\r\n    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.\r\n\r\n  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay\r\n    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,\r\n                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].\r\n\r\n  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Is the day so young?\r\n\r\n  Ben. But new struck nine.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.\r\n    Was that my father that went hence so fast?\r\n\r\n  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.\r\n\r\n  Ben. In love?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Out-\r\n\r\n  Ben. Of love?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,\r\n    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\r\n\r\n  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,\r\n    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!\r\n    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\r\n    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\r\n    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.\r\n    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\r\n    O anything, of nothing first create!\r\n    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!\r\n    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\r\n    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\r\n    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is\r\n    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.\r\n    Dost thou not laugh?\r\n\r\n  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Good heart, at what?\r\n\r\n  Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.\r\n    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\r\n    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\r\n    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\r\n    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\r\n    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;\r\n    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;\r\n    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.\r\n    What is it else? A madness most discreet,\r\n    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\r\n    Farewell, my coz.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Soft! I will go along.\r\n    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:\r\n    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?\r\n\r\n  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?\r\n\r\n  Ben. Groan? Why, no;\r\n    But sadly tell me who.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.\r\n    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!\r\n    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\r\n\r\n  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.\r\n\r\n  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.\r\n\r\n  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit\r\n    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,\r\n    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,\r\n    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.\r\n    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,\r\n    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,\r\n    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\r\n    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor\r\n    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\r\n\r\n  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\r\n    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,\r\n    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.\r\n    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\r\n    To merit bliss by making me despair.\r\n    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\r\n    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.\r\n\r\n  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!\r\n\r\n  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.\r\n    Examine other beauties.\r\n\r\n  Rom. 'Tis the way\r\n    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.\r\n    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,\r\n    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.\r\n    He that is strucken blind cannot forget\r\n    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\r\n    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,\r\n    What doth her beauty serve but as a note\r\n    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?\r\n    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.\r\n\r\n  Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II.\r\nA Street.\r\n\r\nEnter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,\r\n    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,\r\n    For men so old as we to keep the peace.\r\n\r\n  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,\r\n    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.\r\n    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\r\n\r\n  Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:\r\n    My child is yet a stranger in the world,\r\n    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\r\n    Let two more summers wither in their pride\r\n    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.\r\n\r\n  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.\r\n\r\n  Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.\r\n    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;\r\n    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.\r\n    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;\r\n    My will to her consent is but a part.\r\n    An she agree, within her scope of choice\r\n    Lies my consent and fair according voice.\r\n    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,\r\n    Whereto I have invited many a guest,\r\n    Such as I love; and you among the store,\r\n    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.\r\n    At my poor house look to behold this night\r\n    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.\r\n    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel\r\n    When well apparell'd April on the heel\r\n    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight\r\n    Among fresh female buds shall you this night\r\n    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\r\n    And like her most whose merit most shall be;\r\n    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,\r\n    May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.\r\n    Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,\r\n    sirrah, trudge about\r\n    Through fair Verona; find those persons out\r\n    Whose names are written there, and to them say,\r\n    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-\r\n                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].\r\n\r\n  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written\r\n    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor\r\n    with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter\r\n    with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are\r\n    here writ, and can never find what names the writing person\r\n    hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!\r\n\r\n                   Enter Benvolio and Romeo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;\r\n    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;\r\n    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\r\n    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.\r\n    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,\r\n    And the rank poison of the old will die.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.\r\n\r\n  Ben. For what, I pray thee?\r\n\r\n  Rom. For your broken shin.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;\r\n    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,\r\n    Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.\r\n\r\n  Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.\r\n\r\n  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can\r\n    you read anything you see?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.\r\n\r\n  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!\r\n\r\n  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.\r\n\r\n      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\r\n      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;\r\n      The lady widow of Vitruvio;\r\n      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;\r\n      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;\r\n      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;\r\n      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\r\n      Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;\r\n      Lucio and the lively Helena.'\r\n\r\n    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they\r\n    come?\r\n\r\n  Serv. Up.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Whither?\r\n\r\n  Serv. To supper, to our house.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Whose house?\r\n\r\n  Serv. My master's.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.\r\n\r\n  Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great\r\n    rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray\r\n    come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.\r\n\r\n  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's\r\n    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;\r\n    With all the admired beauties of Verona.\r\n    Go thither, and with unattainted eye\r\n    Compare her face with some that I shall show,\r\n    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.\r\n\r\n  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye\r\n    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;\r\n    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,\r\n    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!\r\n    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun\r\n    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,\r\n    Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;\r\n    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd\r\n    Your lady's love against some other maid\r\n    That I will show you shining at this feast,\r\n    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,\r\n    But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III.\r\nCapulet's house.\r\n\r\nEnter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,\r\n    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!\r\n    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!\r\n\r\n                         Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jul. How now? Who calls?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Your mother.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Madam, I am here.\r\n    What is your will?\r\n\r\n  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,\r\n    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;\r\n    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.\r\n    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\r\n\r\n  Wife. She's not fourteen.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-\r\n    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-\r\n    She is not fourteen. How long is it now\r\n    To Lammastide?\r\n\r\n  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,\r\n    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\r\n    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)\r\n    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\r\n    She was too good for me. But, as I said,\r\n    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\r\n    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.\r\n    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\r\n    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),\r\n    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;\r\n    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\r\n    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\r\n    My lord and you were then at Mantua.\r\n    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,\r\n    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\r\n    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\r\n    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\r\n    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,\r\n    To bid me trudge.\r\n    And since that time it is eleven years,\r\n    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,\r\n    She could have run and waddled all about;\r\n    For even the day before, she broke her brow;\r\n    And then my husband (God be with his soul!\r\n    'A was a merry man) took up the child.\r\n    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?\r\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\r\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,\r\n    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'\r\n    To see now how a jest shall come about!\r\n    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,\r\n    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,\r\n    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'\r\n\r\n  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh\r\n    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'\r\n    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow\r\n    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;\r\n    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.\r\n    'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?\r\n    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\r\n    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'\r\n\r\n  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\r\n    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.\r\n    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\r\n\r\n  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme\r\n    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\r\n    How stands your disposition to be married?\r\n\r\n  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,\r\n    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.\r\n\r\n  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,\r\n    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,\r\n    Are made already mothers. By my count,\r\n    I was your mother much upon these years\r\n    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:\r\n    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man\r\n    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.\r\n\r\n  Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.\r\n\r\n  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?\r\n    This night you shall behold him at our feast.\r\n    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,\r\n    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;\r\n    Examine every married lineament,\r\n    And see how one another lends content;\r\n    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies\r\n    Find written in the margent of his eyes,\r\n    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,\r\n    To beautify him only lacks a cover.\r\n    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride\r\n    For fair without the fair within to hide.\r\n    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,\r\n    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\r\n    So shall you share all that he doth possess,\r\n    By having him making yourself no less.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men\r\n\r\n  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?\r\n\r\n  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;\r\n    But no more deep will I endart mine eye\r\n    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.\r\n\r\n                        Enter Servingman.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,\r\n    my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and\r\n    everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you\r\n    follow straight.\r\n\r\n  Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].\r\n    Juliet, the County stays.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV.\r\nA street.\r\n\r\nEnter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;\r\nTorchbearers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\r\n    Or shall we on without apology?\r\n\r\n  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.\r\n    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,\r\n    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,\r\n    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;\r\n    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\r\n    After the prompter, for our entrance;\r\n    But, let them measure us by what they will,\r\n    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.\r\n    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\r\n    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead\r\n    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\r\n\r\n  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings\r\n    And soar with them above a common bound.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft\r\n    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound\r\n    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\r\n    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.\r\n\r\n  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-\r\n    Too great oppression for a tender thing.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,\r\n    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.\r\n\r\n  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.\r\n    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\r\n    Give me a case to put my visage in.\r\n    A visor for a visor! What care I\r\n    What curious eye doth quote deformities?\r\n    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in\r\n    But every man betake him to his legs.\r\n\r\n  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart\r\n    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\r\n    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,\r\n    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;\r\n    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!\r\n    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire\r\n    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st\r\n    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!\r\n\r\n  Rom. Nay, that's not so.\r\n\r\n  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay\r\n    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.\r\n    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits\r\n    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.\r\n\r\n  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;\r\n    But 'tis no wit to go.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Why, may one ask?\r\n\r\n  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.\r\n\r\n  Mer. And so did I.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Well, what was yours?\r\n\r\n  Mer. That dreamers often lie.\r\n\r\n  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\r\n\r\n  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\r\n    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\r\n    In shape no bigger than an agate stone\r\n    On the forefinger of an alderman,\r\n    Drawn with a team of little atomies\r\n    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\r\n    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,\r\n    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\r\n    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;\r\n    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;\r\n    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;\r\n    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\r\n    Not half so big as a round little worm\r\n    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;\r\n    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,\r\n    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\r\n    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\r\n    And in this state she 'gallops night by night\r\n    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\r\n    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;\r\n    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\r\n    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\r\n    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\r\n    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\r\n    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\r\n    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\r\n    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\r\n    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,\r\n    Then dreams he of another benefice.\r\n    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\r\n    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\r\n    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\r\n    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon\r\n    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\r\n    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\r\n    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab\r\n    That plats the manes of horses in the night\r\n    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,\r\n    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes\r\n    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\r\n    That presses them and learns them first to bear,\r\n    Making them women of good carriage.\r\n    This is she-\r\n\r\n  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\r\n    Thou talk'st of nothing.\r\n\r\n  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;\r\n    Which are the children of an idle brain,\r\n    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;\r\n    Which is as thin of substance as the air,\r\n    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\r\n    Even now the frozen bosom of the North\r\n    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,\r\n    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.\r\n\r\n  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\r\n    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives\r\n    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\r\n    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date\r\n    With this night's revels and expire the term\r\n    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,\r\n    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.\r\n    But he that hath the steerage of my course\r\n    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!\r\n\r\n  Ben. Strike, drum.\r\n                           They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene V.\r\nCapulet's house.\r\n\r\nServingmen come forth with napkins.\r\n\r\n  1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?\r\n    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!\r\n  2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's\r\n    hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.\r\n  1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,\r\n    look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as\r\n    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and\r\nNell.\r\n    Anthony, and Potpan!\r\n  2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.\r\n  1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and\r\n    sought for, in the great chamber.\r\n  3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!\r\n    Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.\r\n\r\n    Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,\r\n              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests\r\n               and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes\r\n    Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.\r\n    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all\r\n    Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,\r\n    She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?\r\n    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day\r\n    That I have worn a visor and could tell\r\n    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,\r\n    Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!\r\n    You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.\r\n    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.\r\n                                    Music plays, and they dance.\r\n    More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,\r\n    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.\r\n    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.\r\n    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,\r\n    For you and I are past our dancing days.\r\n    How long is't now since last yourself and I\r\n    Were in a mask?\r\n  2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.\r\n\r\n  Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!\r\n    'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,\r\n    Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,\r\n    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.\r\n  2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;\r\n    His son is thirty.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Will you tell me that?\r\n    His son was but a ward two years ago.\r\n\r\n  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the\r\n    hand Of yonder knight?\r\n\r\n  Serv. I know not, sir.\r\n\r\n  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\r\n    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\r\n    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-\r\n    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!\r\n    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\r\n    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.\r\n    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand\r\n    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.\r\n    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!\r\n    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.\r\n\r\n  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.\r\n    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave\r\n    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,\r\n    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?\r\n    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,\r\n    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?\r\n\r\n  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;\r\n    A villain, that is hither come in spite\r\n    To scorn at our solemnity this night.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Young Romeo is it?\r\n\r\n  Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.\r\n    'A bears him like a portly gentleman,\r\n    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him\r\n    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.\r\n    I would not for the wealth of all this town\r\n    Here in my house do him disparagement.\r\n    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.\r\n    It is my will; the which if thou respect,\r\n    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,\r\n    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\r\n\r\n  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.\r\n    I'll not endure him.\r\n\r\n  Cap. He shall be endur'd.\r\n    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!\r\n    Am I the master here, or you? Go to!\r\n    You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!\r\n    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!\r\n    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!\r\n\r\n  Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Go to, go to!\r\n    You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?\r\n    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.\r\n    You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-\r\n    Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!\r\n    Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!\r\n    I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!\r\n\r\n  Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting\r\n    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\r\n    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,\r\n    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.\r\n\r\n  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand\r\n    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:\r\n    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\r\n    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\r\n    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;\r\n    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,\r\n    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\r\n\r\n  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.\r\n\r\n  Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!\r\n    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.\r\n    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]\r\n\r\n  Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!\r\n    Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]\r\n\r\n  Jul. You kiss by th' book.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.\r\n\r\n  Rom. What is her mother?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Marry, bachelor,\r\n    Her mother is the lady of the house.\r\n    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.\r\n    I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.\r\n    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her\r\n    Shall have the chinks.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Is she a Capulet?\r\n    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;\r\n    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.\r\n    Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.\r\n    I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.\r\n    More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.\r\n    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;\r\n    I'll to my rest.\r\n                              Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].\r\n\r\n  Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.\r\n\r\n  Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.\r\n\r\n  Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. I know not.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,\r\n    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,\r\n    The only son of your great enemy.\r\n\r\n  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!\r\n    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!\r\n    Prodigious birth of love it is to me\r\n    That I must love a loathed enemy.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. What's this? what's this?\r\n\r\n  Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now\r\n    Of one I danc'd withal.\r\n                                     One calls within, 'Juliet.'\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Anon, anon!\r\n    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\n\r\nEnter Chorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,\r\n    And young affection gapes to be his heir;\r\n    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,\r\n    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.\r\n    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,\r\n    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;\r\n    But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,\r\n    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.\r\n    Being held a foe, he may not have access\r\n    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,\r\n    And she as much in love, her means much less\r\n    To meet her new beloved anywhere;\r\n    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,\r\n    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.\r\nExit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II. Scene I.\r\nA lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.\r\n\r\nEnter Romeo alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?\r\n    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.\r\n                     [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]\r\n\r\n                   Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!\r\n\r\n  Mer. He is wise,\r\n    And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.\r\n\r\n  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.\r\n    Call, good Mercutio.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.\r\n    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!\r\n    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;\r\n    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!\r\n    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';\r\n    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,\r\n    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,\r\n    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim\r\n    When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!\r\n    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;\r\n    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.\r\n    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.\r\n    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,\r\n    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,\r\n    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,\r\n    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!\r\n\r\n  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.\r\n\r\n  Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him\r\n    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle\r\n    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand\r\n    Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.\r\n    That were some spite; my invocation\r\n    Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,\r\n    I conjure only but to raise up him.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees\r\n    To be consorted with the humorous night.\r\n    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.\r\n\r\n  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.\r\n    Now will he sit under a medlar tree\r\n    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit\r\n    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.\r\n    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were\r\n    An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!\r\n    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;\r\n    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.\r\n    Come, shall we go?\r\n\r\n  Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain\r\n    'To seek him here that means not to be found.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II.\r\nCapulet's orchard.\r\n\r\nEnter Romeo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.\r\n\r\n                     Enter Juliet above at a window.\r\n\r\n    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?\r\n    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!\r\n    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\r\n    Who is already sick and pale with grief\r\n    That thou her maid art far more fair than she.\r\n    Be not her maid, since she is envious.\r\n    Her vestal livery is but sick and green,\r\n    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.\r\n    It is my lady; O, it is my love!\r\n    O that she knew she were!\r\n    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\r\n    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.\r\n    I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.\r\n    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\r\n    Having some business, do entreat her eyes\r\n    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.\r\n    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?\r\n    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\r\n    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\r\n    Would through the airy region stream so bright\r\n    That birds would sing and think it were not night.\r\n    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!\r\n    O that I were a glove upon that hand,\r\n    That I might touch that cheek!\r\n\r\n  Jul. Ay me!\r\n\r\n  Rom. She speaks.\r\n    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\r\n    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\r\n    As is a winged messenger of heaven\r\n    Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes\r\n    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him\r\n    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds\r\n    And sails upon the bosom of the air.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\r\n    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!\r\n    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\r\n    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.\r\n\r\n  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\r\n\r\n  Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\r\n    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.\r\n    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,\r\n    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part\r\n    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!\r\n    What's in a name? That which we call a rose\r\n    By any other name would smell as sweet.\r\n    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,\r\n    Retain that dear perfection which he owes\r\n    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;\r\n    And for that name, which is no part of thee,\r\n    Take all myself.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I take thee at thy word.\r\n    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;\r\n    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.\r\n\r\n  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,\r\n    So stumblest on my counsel?\r\n\r\n  Rom. By a name\r\n    I know not how to tell thee who I am.\r\n    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\r\n    Because it is an enemy to thee.\r\n    Had I it written, I would tear the word.\r\n\r\n  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\r\n    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.\r\n    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.\r\n\r\n  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\r\n    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\r\n    And the place death, considering who thou art,\r\n    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.\r\n\r\n  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;\r\n    For stony limits cannot hold love out,\r\n    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.\r\n    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.\r\n\r\n  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye\r\n    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,\r\n    And I am proof against their enmity.\r\n\r\n  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;\r\n    And but thou love me, let them find me here.\r\n    My life were better ended by their hate\r\n    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\r\n\r\n  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?\r\n\r\n  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.\r\n    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\r\n    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\r\n    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,\r\n    I would adventure for such merchandise.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;\r\n    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\r\n    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.\r\n    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny\r\n    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!\r\n    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';\r\n    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,\r\n    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,\r\n    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\r\n    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\r\n    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\r\n    I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,\r\n    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\r\n    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\r\n    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;\r\n    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\r\n    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.\r\n    I should have been more strange, I must confess,\r\n    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,\r\n    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,\r\n    And not impute this yielding to light love,\r\n    Which the dark night hath so discovered.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,\r\n    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-\r\n\r\n  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,\r\n    That monthly changes in her circled orb,\r\n    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.\r\n\r\n  Rom. What shall I swear by?\r\n\r\n  Jul. Do not swear at all;\r\n    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\r\n    Which is the god of my idolatry,\r\n    And I'll believe thee.\r\n\r\n  Rom. If my heart's dear love-\r\n\r\n  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\r\n    I have no joy of this contract to-night.\r\n    It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;\r\n    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be\r\n    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!\r\n    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\r\n    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.\r\n    Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest\r\n    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!\r\n\r\n  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\r\n\r\n  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.\r\n\r\n  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\r\n    And yet I would it were to give again.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\r\n\r\n  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.\r\n    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.\r\n    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,\r\n    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,\r\n    The more I have, for both are infinite.\r\n    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!\r\n                                           [Nurse] calls within.\r\n    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.\r\n    Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]\r\n\r\n  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,\r\n    Being in night, all this is but a dream,\r\n    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.\r\n\r\n                       Enter Juliet above.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\r\n    If that thy bent of love be honourable,\r\n    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,\r\n    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,\r\n    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;\r\n    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay\r\n    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. (within) Madam!\r\n\r\n  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,\r\n    I do beseech thee-\r\n\r\n  Nurse. (within) Madam!\r\n\r\n  Jul. By-and-by I come.-\r\n    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.\r\n    To-morrow will I send.\r\n\r\n  Rom. So thrive my soul-\r\n\r\n  Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.\r\n\r\n  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!\r\n    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;\r\n    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\r\n\r\n                     Enter Juliet again, [above].\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice\r\n    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!\r\n    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;\r\n    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\r\n    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\r\n    With repetition of my Romeo's name.\r\n    Romeo!\r\n\r\n  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.\r\n    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,\r\n    Like softest music to attending ears!\r\n\r\n  Jul. Romeo!\r\n\r\n  Rom. My dear?\r\n\r\n  Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow\r\n    Shall I send to thee?\r\n\r\n  Rom. By the hour of nine.\r\n\r\n  Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.\r\n    I have forgot why I did call thee back.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.\r\n\r\n  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\r\n    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.\r\n\r\n  Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,\r\n    Forgetting any other home but this.\r\n\r\n  Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-\r\n    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,\r\n    That lets it hop a little from her hand,\r\n    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\r\n    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,\r\n    So loving-jealous of his liberty.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I would I were thy bird.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Sweet, so would I.\r\n    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\r\n    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,\r\n    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.\r\n                                                         [Exit.]\r\n\r\n  Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!\r\n    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!\r\n    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,\r\n    His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\r\n Exit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III.\r\nFriar Laurence's cell.\r\n\r\nEnter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,\r\n    Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;\r\n    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels\r\n    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.\r\n    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye\r\n    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,\r\n    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours\r\n    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\r\n    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.\r\n    What is her burying gave, that is her womb;\r\n    And from her womb children of divers kind\r\n    We sucking on her natural bosom find;\r\n    Many for many virtues excellent,\r\n    None but for some, and yet all different.\r\n    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\r\n    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;\r\n    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live\r\n    But to the earth some special good doth give;\r\n    Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,\r\n    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\r\n    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,\r\n    And vice sometime's by action dignified.\r\n    Within the infant rind of this small flower\r\n    Poison hath residence, and medicine power;\r\n    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;\r\n    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\r\n    Two such opposed kings encamp them still\r\n    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;\r\n    And where the worser is predominant,\r\n    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.\r\n\r\n                        Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rom. Good morrow, father.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Benedicite!\r\n    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\r\n    Young son, it argues a distempered head\r\n    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.\r\n    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,\r\n    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;\r\n    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain\r\n    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.\r\n    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure\r\n    Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;\r\n    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-\r\n    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.\r\n\r\n  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.\r\n\r\n  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?\r\n\r\n  Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\r\n    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.\r\n\r\n  Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?\r\n\r\n  Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\r\n    I have been feasting with mine enemy,\r\n    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me\r\n    That's by me wounded. Both our remedies\r\n    Within thy help and holy physic lies.\r\n    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,\r\n    My intercession likewise steads my foe.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift\r\n    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set\r\n    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;\r\n    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,\r\n    And all combin'd, save what thou must combine\r\n    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how\r\n    We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,\r\n    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\r\n    That thou consent to marry us to-day.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!\r\n    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\r\n    So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies\r\n    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\r\n    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine\r\n    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\r\n    How much salt water thrown away in waste,\r\n    To season love, that of it doth not taste!\r\n    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\r\n    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.\r\n    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\r\n    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.\r\n    If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\r\n    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.\r\n    And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:\r\n    Women may fall when there's no strength in men.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.\r\n\r\n  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\r\n\r\n  Rom. And bad'st me bury love.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Not in a grave\r\n    To lay one in, another out to have.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now\r\n    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.\r\n    The other did not so.\r\n\r\n  Friar. O, she knew well\r\n    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\r\n    But come, young waverer, come go with me.\r\n    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;\r\n    For this alliance may so happy prove\r\n    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.\r\n\r\n  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV.\r\nA street.\r\n\r\nEnter Benvolio and Mercutio.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?\r\n    Came he not home to-night?\r\n\r\n  Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,\r\n    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,\r\n    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.\r\n\r\n  Mer. A challenge, on my life.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Romeo will answer it.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,\r\n    being dared.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white\r\n    wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the\r\n    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's\r\n    butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?\r\n\r\n  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?\r\n\r\n  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the\r\n    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing\r\n    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his\r\n    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very\r\n    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman\r\n    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the\r\n    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.\r\n\r\n  Ben. The what?\r\n\r\n  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-\r\n    these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very\r\n    tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,\r\n    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange\r\n    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand\r\n    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old\r\n    bench? O, their bones, their bones!\r\n\r\n                               Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!\r\n\r\n  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how\r\n    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch\r\n    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she\r\n    had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,\r\n    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,\r\n    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French\r\n    salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit\r\n    fairly last night.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\r\n\r\n  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a\r\n    case as mine a man may strain courtesy.\r\n\r\n  Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a\r\n    man to bow in the hams.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.\r\n\r\n  Rom. A most courteous exposition.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Pink for flower.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Right.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out\r\n    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may\r\n    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.\r\n\r\n  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!\r\n\r\n  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for\r\n    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am\r\n    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not\r\n    there for the goose.\r\n\r\n  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!\r\n\r\n  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.\r\n\r\n  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?\r\n\r\n  Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch\r\n    narrow to an ell broad!\r\n\r\n  Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to\r\n    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now\r\n    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by\r\n    art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a\r\n    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in\r\n    a hole.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Stop there, stop there!\r\n\r\n  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\r\n\r\n  Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I\r\n    was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to\r\n    occupy the argument no longer.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Here's goodly gear!\r\n\r\n                      Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mer. A sail, a sail!\r\n\r\n  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Peter!\r\n\r\n  Peter. Anon.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. My fan, Peter.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of\r\n    the two.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n  Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Is it good-den?\r\n\r\n  Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is\r\n    now upon the prick of noon.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!\r\n\r\n  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'\r\n    quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the\r\n    young Romeo?\r\n\r\n  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you\r\n    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest\r\n    of that name, for fault of a worse.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. You say well.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,\r\n    wisely.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\r\n\r\n  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.\r\n\r\n  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\r\n\r\n  Rom. What hast thou found?\r\n\r\n  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is\r\n    something stale and hoar ere it be spent\r\n                                     He walks by them and sings.\r\n\r\n                   An old hare hoar,\r\n                   And an old hare hoar,\r\n                Is very good meat in Lent;\r\n                   But a hare that is hoar\r\n                   Is too much for a score\r\n                When it hoars ere it be spent.\r\n\r\n    Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I will follow you.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,\r\n    [sings] lady, lady, lady.\r\n                                      Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant\r\n    was this that was so full of his ropery?\r\n\r\n  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and\r\n    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an\r\n'a\r\n    were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,\r\n    I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his\r\n    flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must\r\n    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!\r\n\r\n  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my\r\n    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as\r\n    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the\r\n    law on my side.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me\r\n    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,\r\n    my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I\r\n    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead\r\n    her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of\r\n    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and\r\n    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were\r\n    an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\r\n    thee-\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,\r\n    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.\r\n\r\n  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I\r\n    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Bid her devise\r\n    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;\r\n    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell\r\n    Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\r\n\r\n  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\r\n    Within this hour my man shall be with thee\r\n    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\r\n    Which to the high topgallant of my joy\r\n    Must be my convoy in the secret night.\r\n    Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.\r\n    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\r\n\r\n  Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,\r\n    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?\r\n\r\n  Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!\r\n    when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in\r\n    town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,\r\n    good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I\r\n    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;\r\n    but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any\r\n    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both\r\n    with a letter?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I\r\n    know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest\r\n    sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you\r\n    good to hear it.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Commend me to thy lady.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!\r\n\r\n  Peter. Anon.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene V.\r\nCapulet's orchard.\r\n\r\nEnter Juliet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;\r\n    In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.\r\n    Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.\r\n    O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,\r\n    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams\r\n    Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.\r\n    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,\r\n    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\r\n    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill\r\n    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve\r\n    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.\r\n    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,\r\n    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;\r\n    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,\r\n    And his to me,\r\n    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-\r\n    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\r\n\r\n                      Enter Nurse [and Peter].\r\n\r\n    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?\r\n    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.\r\n                                                   [Exit Peter.]\r\n\r\n  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?\r\n    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\r\n    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news\r\n    By playing it to me with so sour a face.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.\r\n    Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!\r\n\r\n  Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.\r\n    Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?\r\n    Do you not see that I am out of breath?\r\n\r\n  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath\r\n    To say to me that thou art out of breath?\r\n    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay\r\n    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\r\n    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.\r\n    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.\r\n    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to\r\n    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better\r\n    than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a\r\n    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet\r\n    they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll\r\n    warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve\r\nGod.\r\n    What, have you din'd at home?\r\n\r\n  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.\r\n    What says he of our marriage? What of that?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\r\n    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\r\n    My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!\r\n    Beshrew your heart for sending me about\r\n    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!\r\n\r\n  Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\r\n    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,\r\n    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where\r\n    is your mother?\r\n\r\n  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.\r\n    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!\r\n    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\r\n    \"Where is your mother?\"'\r\n\r\n  Nurse. O God's Lady dear!\r\n    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.\r\n    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?\r\n    Henceforward do your messages yourself.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?\r\n\r\n  Jul. I have.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;\r\n    There stays a husband to make you a wife.\r\n    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:\r\n    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.\r\n    Hie you to church; I must another way,\r\n    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love\r\n    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.\r\n    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;\r\n    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.\r\n    Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene VI.\r\nFriar Laurence's cell.\r\n\r\nEnter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act\r\n    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!\r\n\r\n  Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,\r\n    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy\r\n    That one short minute gives me in her sight.\r\n    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,\r\n    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-\r\n    It is enough I may but call her mine.\r\n\r\n  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends\r\n    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,\r\n    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey\r\n    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness\r\n    And in the taste confounds the appetite.\r\n    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;\r\n    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\r\n\r\n                     Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\n    Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot\r\n    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.\r\n    A lover may bestride the gossamer\r\n    That idles in the wanton summer air,\r\n    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\r\n\r\n  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\r\n    Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more\r\n    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\r\n    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue\r\n    Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both\r\n    Receive in either by this dear encounter.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,\r\n    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.\r\n    They are but beggars that can count their worth;\r\n    But my true love is grown to such excess\r\n    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;\r\n    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\r\n    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.\r\n                                                       [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT III. Scene I.\r\nA public place.\r\n\r\nEnter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.\r\n    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.\r\n    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,\r\n    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters\r\n    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and\r\n    says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the\r\n    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?\r\n\r\n  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in\r\n    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be\r\n    moved.\r\n\r\n  Ben. And what to?\r\n\r\n  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,\r\n    for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a\r\n    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.\r\n    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no\r\n    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an\r\n    eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels\r\n    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as\r\n    addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a\r\n    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog\r\n    that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a\r\n    tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with\r\n    another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt\r\n    tutor me from quarrelling!\r\n\r\n  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should\r\n    buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\r\n\r\n  Mer. The fee simple? O simple!\r\n\r\n                       Enter Tybalt and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.\r\n\r\n  Mer. By my heel, I care not.\r\n\r\n  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.\r\n    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.\r\n\r\n  Mer. And but one word with one of us?\r\n    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.\r\n\r\n  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me\r\n    occasion.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving\r\n\r\n  Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make\r\n    minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my\r\n    fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\r\n\r\n  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.\r\n    Either withdraw unto some private place\r\n    And reason coldly of your grievances,\r\n    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\r\n    I will not budge for no man's pleasure,\r\n\r\n                        Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.\r\n\r\n  Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.\r\n    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!\r\n    Your worship in that sense may call him man.\r\n\r\n  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford\r\n    No better term than this: thou art a villain.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\r\n    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage\r\n    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.\r\n    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.\r\n\r\n  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries\r\n    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,\r\n    But love thee better than thou canst devise\r\n    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;\r\n    And so good Capulet, which name I tender\r\n    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\r\n\r\n  Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\r\n    Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]\r\n    Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?\r\n\r\n  Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?\r\n\r\n  Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.\r\nThat I\r\n    mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,\r\n\r\n    dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out\r\n    of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your\r\n    ears ere it be out.\r\n\r\n  Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]\r\n\r\n  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Come, sir, your passado!\r\n                                                   [They fight.]\r\n\r\n  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\r\n    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!\r\n    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath\r\n    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.\r\n    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\r\n         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies\r\n                                           [with his Followers].\r\n\r\n  Mer. I am hurt.\r\n    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.\r\n    Is he gone and hath nothing?\r\n\r\n  Ben. What, art thou hurt?\r\n\r\n  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.\r\n    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.\r\n                                                    [Exit Page.]\r\n\r\n  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.\r\n\r\n  Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;\r\n    but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you\r\n    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this\r\n    world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a\r\n    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,\r\na\r\n    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil\r\n    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I thought all for the best.\r\n\r\n  Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,\r\n    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!\r\n    They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,\r\n    And soundly too. Your houses!\r\n                                 [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].\r\n\r\n  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,\r\n    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt\r\n    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd\r\n    With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour\r\n    Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,\r\n    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate\r\n    And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel\r\n\r\n                      Enter Benvolio.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!\r\n    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,\r\n    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.\r\n\r\n  Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;\r\n    This but begins the woe others must end.\r\n\r\n                       Enter Tybalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?\r\n    Away to heaven respective lenity,\r\n    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!\r\n    Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again\r\n    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul\r\n    Is but a little way above our heads,\r\n    Staying for thine to keep him company.\r\n    Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.\r\n\r\n  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,\r\n    Shalt with him hence.\r\n\r\n  Rom. This shall determine that.\r\n                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.\r\n\r\n  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!\r\n    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.\r\n    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death\r\n    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!\r\n\r\n  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!\r\n\r\n  Ben. Why dost thou stay?\r\n                                                     Exit Romeo.\r\n                      Enter Citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?\r\n    Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?\r\n\r\n  Ben. There lies that Tybalt.\r\n\r\n  Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.\r\n    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,\r\n                     and [others].\r\n\r\n\r\n  Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?\r\n\r\n  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all\r\n    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.\r\n    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,\r\n    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!\r\n    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd\r\n    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,\r\n    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.\r\n    O cousin, cousin!\r\n\r\n  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?\r\n\r\n  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.\r\n    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\r\n    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal\r\n    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered\r\n    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-\r\n    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen\r\n    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts\r\n    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;\r\n    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\r\n    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\r\n    Cold death aside and with the other sends\r\n    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\r\n    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,\r\n    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,\r\n    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,\r\n    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\r\n    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\r\n    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;\r\n    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,\r\n    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,\r\n    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I\r\n    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;\r\n    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.\r\n    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;\r\n    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.\r\n    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,\r\n    And all those twenty could but kill one life.\r\n    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.\r\n    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.\r\n\r\n  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.\r\n    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\r\n\r\n  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;\r\n    His fault concludes but what the law should end,\r\n    The life of Tybalt.\r\n\r\n  Prince. And for that offence\r\n    Immediately we do exile him hence.\r\n    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,\r\n    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;\r\n    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine\r\n    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.\r\n    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;\r\n    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\r\n    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\r\n    Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.\r\n    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.\r\n    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II.\r\nCapulet's orchard.\r\n\r\nEnter Juliet alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,\r\n    Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner\r\n    As Phaeton would whip you to the West\r\n    And bring in cloudy night immediately.\r\n    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,\r\n    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo\r\n    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.\r\n    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites\r\n    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,\r\n    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,\r\n    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,\r\n    And learn me how to lose a winning match,\r\n    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\r\n    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,\r\n    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,\r\n    Think true love acted simple modesty.\r\n    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;\r\n    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\r\n    Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.\r\n    Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;\r\n    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,\r\n    Take him and cut him out in little stars,\r\n    And he will make the face of heaven so fine\r\n    That all the world will be in love with night\r\n    And pay no worship to the garish sun.\r\n    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,\r\n    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,\r\n    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day\r\n    As is the night before some festival\r\n    To an impatient child that hath new robes\r\n    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,\r\n\r\n                Enter Nurse, with cords.\r\n\r\n    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks\r\n    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.\r\n    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords\r\n    That Romeo bid thee fetch?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.\r\n                                             [Throws them down.]\r\n\r\n  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!\r\n    We are undone, lady, we are undone!\r\n    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!\r\n\r\n  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Romeo can,\r\n    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!\r\n    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!\r\n\r\n  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?\r\n    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.\r\n    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'\r\n    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more\r\n    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.\r\n    I am not I, if there be such an 'I';\r\n    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'\r\n    If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'\r\n    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\r\n    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.\r\n    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\r\n    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,\r\n    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!\r\n    To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!\r\n    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,\r\n    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!\r\n\r\n  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!\r\n    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman\r\n    That ever I should live to see thee dead!\r\n\r\n  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?\r\n    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?\r\n    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?\r\n    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!\r\n    For who is living, if those two are gone?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;\r\n    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!\r\n\r\n  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!\r\n    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?\r\n    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!\r\n    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!\r\n    Despised substance of divinest show!\r\n    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-\r\n    A damned saint, an honourable villain!\r\n    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell\r\n    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend\r\n    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?\r\n    Was ever book containing such vile matter\r\n    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell\r\n    In such a gorgeous palace!\r\n\r\n  Nurse. There's no trust,\r\n    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,\r\n    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.\r\n    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.\r\n    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.\r\n    Shame come to Romeo!\r\n\r\n  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue\r\n    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.\r\n    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;\r\n    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd\r\n    Sole monarch of the universal earth.\r\n    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?\r\n\r\n  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?\r\n    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name\r\n    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?\r\n    But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\r\n    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.\r\n    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!\r\n    Your tributary drops belong to woe,\r\n    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.\r\n    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;\r\n    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.\r\n    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?\r\n    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,\r\n    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;\r\n    But O, it presses to my memory\r\n    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!\r\n    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'\r\n    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'\r\n    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death\r\n    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;\r\n    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship\r\n    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,\r\n    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'\r\n    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,\r\n    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?\r\n    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,\r\n    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word\r\n    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\r\n    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-\r\n    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,\r\n    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.\r\n    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.\r\n    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,\r\n    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.\r\n    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,\r\n    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.\r\n    He made you for a highway to my bed;\r\n    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.\r\n    Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;\r\n    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo\r\n    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.\r\n    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.\r\n    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight\r\n    And bid him come to take his last farewell.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III.\r\nFriar Laurence's cell.\r\n\r\nEnter Friar [Laurence].\r\n\r\n\r\n  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.\r\n    Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,\r\n    And thou art wedded to calamity.\r\n\r\n                         Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom\r\n    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand\r\n    That I yet know not?\r\n\r\n  Friar. Too familiar\r\n    Is my dear son with such sour company.\r\n    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.\r\n\r\n  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?\r\n\r\n  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-\r\n    Not body's death, but body's banishment.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';\r\n    For exile hath more terror in his look,\r\n    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'\r\n\r\n  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.\r\n    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.\r\n\r\n  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,\r\n    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.\r\n    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,\r\n    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'\r\n    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'\r\n    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe\r\n    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\r\n\r\n  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!\r\n    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,\r\n    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,\r\n    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.\r\n    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.\r\n\r\n  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,\r\n    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog\r\n    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,\r\n    Live here in heaven and may look on her;\r\n    But Romeo may not. More validity,\r\n    More honourable state, more courtship lives\r\n    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\r\n    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand\r\n    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,\r\n    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,\r\n    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;\r\n    But Romeo may not- he is banished.\r\n    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;\r\n    They are free men, but I am banished.\r\n    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?\r\n    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,\r\n    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,\r\n    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?\r\n    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;\r\n    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,\r\n    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,\r\n    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,\r\n    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?\r\n\r\n  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.\r\n\r\n  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\r\n\r\n  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;\r\n    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,\r\n    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!\r\n    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,\r\n    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,\r\n    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.\r\n\r\n  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.\r\n\r\n  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\r\n\r\n  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\r\n    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\r\n    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\r\n    Doting like me, and like me banished,\r\n    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\r\n    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,\r\n    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.\r\n                                                 Knock [within].\r\n\r\n  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,\r\n    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;\r\n    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.\r\n    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,\r\n    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.\r\n    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will\r\n\r\n  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.\r\n    I come from Lady Juliet.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Welcome then.\r\n\r\n                       Enter Nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar\r\n    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?\r\n\r\n  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,\r\n    Just in her case!\r\n\r\n  Friar. O woeful sympathy!\r\n    Piteous predicament!\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Even so lies she,\r\n    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\r\n    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.\r\n    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!\r\n    Why should you fall into so deep an O?\r\n\r\n  Rom. (rises) Nurse-\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\r\n    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,\r\n    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy\r\n    With blood remov'd but little from her own?\r\n    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says\r\n    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\r\n    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\r\n    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,\r\n    And then down falls again.\r\n\r\n  Rom. As if that name,\r\n    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,\r\n    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand\r\n    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,\r\n    In what vile part of this anatomy\r\n    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\r\n    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]\r\n\r\n  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.\r\n    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;\r\n    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\r\n    The unreasonable fury of a beast.\r\n    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!\r\n    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\r\n    Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,\r\n    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.\r\n    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\r\n    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,\r\n    By doing damned hate upon thyself?\r\n    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?\r\n    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet\r\n    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\r\n    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\r\n    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,\r\n    And usest none in that true use indeed\r\n    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\r\n    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax\r\n    Digressing from the valour of a man;\r\n    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\r\n    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;\r\n    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\r\n    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,\r\n    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,\r\n    is get afire by thine own ignorance,\r\n    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.\r\n    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,\r\n    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\r\n    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\r\n    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.\r\n    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend\r\n    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.\r\n    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;\r\n    Happiness courts thee in her best array;\r\n    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,\r\n    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.\r\n    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\r\n    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,\r\n    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.\r\n    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,\r\n    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,\r\n    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time\r\n    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\r\n    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\r\n    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy\r\n    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.\r\n    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,\r\n    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,\r\n    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\r\n    Romeo is coming.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night\r\n    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!\r\n    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.\r\n    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.\r\n\r\n  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!\r\n\r\n  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:\r\n    Either be gone before the watch be set,\r\n    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.\r\n    Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,\r\n    And he shall signify from time to time\r\n    Every good hap to you that chances here.\r\n    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.\r\n\r\n  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,\r\n    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.\r\n    Farewell.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV.\r\nCapulet's house\r\n\r\nEnter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily\r\n    That we have had no time to move our daughter.\r\n    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,\r\n    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.\r\n    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.\r\n    I promise you, but for your company,\r\n    I would have been abed an hour ago.\r\n\r\n  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.\r\n    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.\r\n\r\n  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;\r\n    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\r\n    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd\r\n    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.\r\n    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;\r\n    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love\r\n    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-\r\n    But, soft! what day is this?\r\n\r\n  Par. Monday, my lord.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.\r\n    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her\r\n    She shall be married to this noble earl.\r\n    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?\r\n    We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;\r\n    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\r\n    It may be thought we held him carelessly,\r\n    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.\r\n    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,\r\n    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\r\n\r\n  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.\r\n    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;\r\n    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.\r\n    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!\r\n    Afore me, It is so very very late\r\n    That we may call it early by-and-by.\r\n    Good night.\r\n                                                          Exeunt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene V.\r\nCapulet's orchard.\r\n\r\nEnter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.\r\n    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,\r\n    That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.\r\n    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\r\n    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.\r\n\r\n  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;\r\n    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\r\n    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.\r\n    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day\r\n    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\r\n    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.\r\n    It is some meteor that the sun exhales\r\n    To be to thee this night a torchbearer\r\n    And light thee on the way to Mantua.\r\n    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.\r\n    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.\r\n    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,\r\n    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;\r\n    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\r\n    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\r\n    I have more care to stay than will to go.\r\n    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.\r\n    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.\r\n\r\n  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!\r\n    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,\r\n    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\r\n    Some say the lark makes sweet division;\r\n    This doth not so, for she divideth us.\r\n    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;\r\n    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,\r\n    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\r\n    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!\r\n    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.\r\n\r\n  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!\r\n\r\n                          Enter Nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Madam!\r\n\r\n  Jul. Nurse?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.\r\n    The day is broke; be wary, look about.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.\r\n                                                         [Exit.]\r\n\r\n  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.\r\n                                                  He goeth down.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?\r\n    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,\r\n    For in a minute there are many days.\r\n    O, by this count I shall be much in years\r\n    Ere I again behold my Romeo!\r\n\r\n  Rom. Farewell!\r\n    I will omit no opportunity\r\n    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?\r\n\r\n  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve\r\n    For sweet discourses in our time to come.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!\r\n    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,\r\n    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.\r\n    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.\r\n\r\n  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.\r\n    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!\r\nExit.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.\r\n    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him\r\n    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,\r\n    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long\r\n    But send him back.\r\n\r\n  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?\r\n\r\n  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.\r\n    Is she not down so late, or up so early?\r\n    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?\r\n\r\n                       Enter Mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?\r\n\r\n  Jul. Madam, I am not well.\r\n\r\n  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?\r\n    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\r\n    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.\r\n    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;\r\n    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\r\n\r\n  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\r\n    Which you weep for.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Feeling so the loss,\r\n    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\r\n\r\n  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death\r\n    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.\r\n\r\n  Jul. What villain, madam?\r\n\r\n  Lady. That same villain Romeo.\r\n\r\n  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-\r\n    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;\r\n    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\r\n\r\n  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.\r\n    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!\r\n\r\n  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\r\n    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,\r\n    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,\r\n    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram\r\n    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;\r\n    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied\r\n    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-\r\n    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.\r\n    Madam, if you could find out but a man\r\n    To bear a poison, I would temper it;\r\n    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,\r\n    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\r\n    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,\r\n    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt\r\n    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!\r\n\r\n  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.\r\n    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\r\n\r\n  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.\r\n    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?\r\n\r\n  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\r\n    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,\r\n    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy\r\n    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?\r\n\r\n  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn\r\n    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\r\n    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,\r\n    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,\r\n    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!\r\n    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed\r\n    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.\r\n    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,\r\n    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear\r\n    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\r\n    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!\r\n\r\n  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,\r\n    And see how be will take it at your hands.\r\n\r\n                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,\r\n    But for the sunset of my brother's son\r\n    It rains downright.\r\n    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\r\n    Evermore show'ring? In one little body\r\n    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:\r\n    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\r\n    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is\r\n    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,\r\n    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,\r\n    Without a sudden calm will overset\r\n    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?\r\n    Have you delivered to her our decree?\r\n\r\n  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\r\n    I would the fool were married to her grave!\r\n\r\n  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.\r\n    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\r\n    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,\r\n    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought\r\n    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?\r\n\r\n  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.\r\n    Proud can I never be of what I hate,\r\n    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.\r\n\r\n  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?\r\n    'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-\r\n    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,\r\n    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\r\n    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next\r\n    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,\r\n    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\r\n    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!\r\n    You tallow-face!\r\n\r\n  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?\r\n\r\n  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,\r\n    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!\r\n    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday\r\n    Or never after look me in the face.\r\n    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!\r\n    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest\r\n    That God had lent us but this only child;\r\n    But now I see this one is one too much,\r\n    And that we have a curse in having her.\r\n    Out on her, hilding!\r\n\r\n  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!\r\n    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\r\n\r\n  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,\r\n    Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!\r\n\r\n  Nurse. I speak no treason.\r\n\r\n  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!\r\n\r\n  Nurse. May not one speak?\r\n\r\n  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!\r\n    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,\r\n    For here we need it not.\r\n\r\n  Lady. You are too hot.\r\n\r\n  Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,\r\n    At home, abroad, alone, in company,\r\n    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been\r\n    To have her match'd; and having now provided\r\n    A gentleman of princely parentage,\r\n    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,\r\n    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,\r\n    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-\r\n    And then to have a wretched puling fool,\r\n    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,\r\n    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;\r\n    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!\r\n    But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.\r\n    Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.\r\n    Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.\r\n    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:\r\n    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;\r\n    An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\r\n    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,\r\n    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.\r\n    Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds\r\n    That sees into the bottom of my grief?\r\n    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!\r\n    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;\r\n    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed\r\n    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\r\n\r\n  Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.\r\n    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?\r\n    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.\r\n    How shall that faith return again to earth\r\n    Unless that husband send it me from heaven\r\n    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.\r\n    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems\r\n    Upon so soft a subject as myself!\r\n    What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?\r\n    Some comfort, nurse.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Faith, here it is.\r\n    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing\r\n    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;\r\n    Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.\r\n    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,\r\n    I think it best you married with the County.\r\n    O, he's a lovely gentleman!\r\n    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,\r\n    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\r\n    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,\r\n    I think you are happy in this second match,\r\n    For it excels your first; or if it did not,\r\n    Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were\r\n    As living here and you no use of him.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Amen!\r\n\r\n  Nurse. What?\r\n\r\n  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.\r\n    Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,\r\n    Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,\r\n    To make confession and to be absolv'd.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!\r\n    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,\r\n    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue\r\n    Which she hath prais'd him with above compare\r\n    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!\r\n    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.\r\n    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.\r\n    If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT IV. Scene I.\r\nFriar Laurence's cell.\r\n\r\nEnter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.\r\n\r\n  Par. My father Capulet will have it so,\r\n    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\r\n\r\n  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.\r\n    Uneven is the course; I like it not.\r\n\r\n  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,\r\n    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;\r\n    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\r\n    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous\r\n    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,\r\n    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage\r\n    To stop the inundation of her tears,\r\n    Which, too much minded by herself alone,\r\n    May be put from her by society.\r\n    Now do you know the reason of this haste.\r\n\r\n  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-\r\n    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\r\n\r\n                    Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!\r\n\r\n  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\r\n\r\n  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.\r\n\r\n  Jul. What must be shall be.\r\n\r\n  Friar. That's a certain text.\r\n\r\n  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?\r\n\r\n  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.\r\n\r\n  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.\r\n\r\n  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.\r\n\r\n  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\r\n\r\n  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,\r\n    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.\r\n\r\n  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.\r\n\r\n  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,\r\n    For it was bad enough before their spite.\r\n\r\n  Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.\r\n\r\n  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;\r\n    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.\r\n\r\n  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.\r\n\r\n  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.\r\n    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,\r\n    Or shall I come to you at evening mass\r\n\r\n  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\r\n    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.\r\n\r\n  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!\r\n    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.\r\n    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,\r\n    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!\r\n\r\n  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;\r\n    It strains me past the compass of my wits.\r\n    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\r\n    On Thursday next be married to this County.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,\r\n    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\r\n    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,\r\n    Do thou but call my resolution wise\r\n    And with this knife I'll help it presently.\r\n    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;\r\n    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,\r\n    Shall be the label to another deed,\r\n    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt\r\n    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.\r\n    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,\r\n    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,\r\n    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\r\n    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that\r\n    Which the commission of thy years and art\r\n    Could to no issue of true honour bring.\r\n    Be not so long to speak. I long to die\r\n    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\r\n    Which craves as desperate an execution\r\n    As that is desperate which we would prevent.\r\n    If, rather than to marry County Paris\r\n    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\r\n    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake\r\n    A thing like death to chide away this shame,\r\n    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;\r\n    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\r\n    From off the battlements of yonder tower,\r\n    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\r\n    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,\r\n    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,\r\n    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,\r\n    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\r\n    Or bid me go into a new-made grave\r\n    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-\r\n    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-\r\n    And I will do it without fear or doubt,\r\n    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent\r\n    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.\r\n    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;\r\n    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\r\n    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,\r\n    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;\r\n    When presently through all thy veins shall run\r\n    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\r\n    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;\r\n    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;\r\n    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\r\n    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall\r\n    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;\r\n    Each part, depriv'd of supple government,\r\n    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;\r\n    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death\r\n    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,\r\n    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\r\n    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes\r\n    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\r\n    Then, as the manner of our country is,\r\n    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier\r\n    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\r\n    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\r\n    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,\r\n    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;\r\n    And hither shall he come; and he and I\r\n    Will watch thy waking, and that very night\r\n    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\r\n    And this shall free thee from this present shame,\r\n    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\r\n    Abate thy valour in the acting it.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!\r\n\r\n  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous\r\n    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed\r\n    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.\r\n    Farewell, dear father.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II.\r\nCapulet's house.\r\n\r\nEnter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,\r\n                        two or three.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.\r\n                                            [Exit a Servingman.]\r\n    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.\r\n\r\n  Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can\r\n    lick their fingers.\r\n\r\n  Cap. How canst thou try them so?\r\n\r\n  Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own\r\n    fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not\r\n    with me.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Go, begone.\r\n                                                Exit Servingman.\r\n    We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.\r\n    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Ay, forsooth.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.\r\n    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.\r\n\r\n                        Enter Juliet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.\r\n\r\n  Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?\r\n\r\n  Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin\r\n    Of disobedient opposition\r\n    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd\r\n    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here\r\n    To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!\r\n    Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.\r\n    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n  Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell\r\n    And gave him what becomed love I might,\r\n    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.\r\n    This is as't should be. Let me see the County.\r\n    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.\r\n    Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,\r\n    All our whole city is much bound to him.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet\r\n    To help me sort such needful ornaments\r\n    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?\r\n\r\n  Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.\r\n                                        Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.\r\n\r\n  Mother. We shall be short in our provision.\r\n    'Tis now near night.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Tush, I will stir about,\r\n    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.\r\n    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.\r\n    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.\r\n    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!\r\n    They are all forth; well, I will walk myself\r\n    To County Paris, to prepare him up\r\n    Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,\r\n    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III.\r\nJuliet's chamber.\r\n\r\nEnter Juliet and Nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,\r\n    I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;\r\n    For I have need of many orisons\r\n    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,\r\n    Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.\r\n\r\n                          Enter Mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?\r\n\r\n  Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries\r\n    As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.\r\n    So please you, let me now be left alone,\r\n    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;\r\n    For I am sure you have your hands full all\r\n    In this so sudden business.\r\n\r\n  Mother. Good night.\r\n    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.\r\n                                      Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]\r\n\r\n  Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.\r\n    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins\r\n    That almost freezes up the heat of life.\r\n    I'll call them back again to comfort me.\r\n    Nurse!- What should she do here?\r\n    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.\r\n    Come, vial.\r\n    What if this mixture do not work at all?\r\n    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?\r\n    No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.\r\n                                             Lays down a dagger.\r\n    What if it be a poison which the friar\r\n    Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,\r\n    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd\r\n    Because he married me before to Romeo?\r\n    I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,\r\n    For he hath still been tried a holy man.\r\n    I will not entertain so bad a thought.\r\n    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,\r\n    I wake before the time that Romeo\r\n    Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!\r\n    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,\r\n    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,\r\n    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?\r\n    Or, if I live, is it not very like\r\n    The horrible conceit of death and night,\r\n    Together with the terror of the place-\r\n    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle\r\n    Where for this many hundred years the bones\r\n    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;\r\n    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,\r\n    Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,\r\n    At some hours in the night spirits resort-\r\n    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,\r\n    So early waking- what with loathsome smells,\r\n    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,\r\n    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-\r\n    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,\r\n    Environed with all these hideous fears,\r\n    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,\r\n    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,\r\n    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone\r\n    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?\r\n    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost\r\n    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body\r\n    Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!\r\n    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.\r\n\r\n        She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene IV.\r\nCapulet's house.\r\n\r\nEnter Lady of the House and Nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.\r\n\r\n                       Enter Old Capulet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,\r\n    The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.\r\n    Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;\r\n    Spare not for cost.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,\r\n    Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow\r\n    For this night's watching.\r\n\r\n  Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now\r\n    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.\r\n\r\n  Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;\r\n    But I will watch you from such watching now.\r\n                                          Exeunt Lady and Nurse.\r\n\r\n  Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!\r\n\r\n\r\n  Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.\r\n\r\n    What is there? Now, fellow,\r\n\r\n  Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier\r\n      logs.\r\n    Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.\r\n\r\n  Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs\r\n    And never trouble Peter for the matter.\r\n\r\n  Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!\r\n    Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.\r\n    The County will be here with music straight,\r\n    For so he said he would.                         Play music.\r\n    I hear him near.\r\n    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!\r\n\r\n                              Enter Nurse.\r\n    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.\r\n    I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,\r\n    Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:\r\n    Make haste, I say.\r\n                                                       [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene V.\r\nJuliet's chamber.\r\n\r\n[Enter Nurse.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.\r\n    Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!\r\n    Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!\r\n    What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!\r\n    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,\r\n    The County Paris hath set up his rest\r\n    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!\r\n    Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!\r\n    I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!\r\n    Ay, let the County take you in your bed!\r\n    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?\r\n                                     [Draws aside the curtains.]\r\n    What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?\r\n    I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!\r\n    Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!\r\n    O weraday that ever I was born!\r\n    Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!\r\n\r\n                           Enter Mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mother. What noise is here?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. O lamentable day!\r\n\r\n  Mother. What is the matter?\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!\r\n\r\n  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!\r\n    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!\r\n    Help, help! Call help.\r\n\r\n                            Enter Father.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!\r\n\r\n  Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!\r\n\r\n  Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,\r\n    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;\r\n    Life and these lips have long been separated.\r\n    Death lies on her like an untimely frost\r\n    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. O lamentable day!\r\n\r\n  Mother. O woful time!\r\n\r\n  Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,\r\n    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?\r\n\r\n  Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.\r\n    O son, the night before thy wedding day\r\n    Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,\r\n    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.\r\n    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;\r\n    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die\r\n    And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.\r\n\r\n  Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,\r\n    And doth it give me such a sight as this?\r\n\r\n  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!\r\n    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw\r\n    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!\r\n    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,\r\n    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,\r\n    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!\r\n\r\n  Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!\r\n    Most lamentable day, most woful day\r\n    That ever ever I did yet behold!\r\n    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!\r\n    Never was seen so black a day as this.\r\n    O woful day! O woful day!\r\n\r\n  Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!\r\n    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,\r\n    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!\r\n    O love! O life! not life, but love in death\r\n\r\n  Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!\r\n    Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now\r\n    To murther, murther our solemnity?\r\n    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!\r\n    Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,\r\n    And with my child my joys are buried!\r\n\r\n  Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not\r\n    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself\r\n    Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,\r\n    And all the better is it for the maid.\r\n    Your part in her you could not keep from death,\r\n    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.\r\n    The most you sought was her promotion,\r\n    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;\r\n    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd\r\n    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?\r\n    O, in this love, you love your child so ill\r\n    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.\r\n    She's not well married that lives married long,\r\n    But she's best married that dies married young.\r\n    Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary\r\n    On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,\r\n    In all her best array bear her to church;\r\n    For though fond nature bids us all lament,\r\n    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.\r\n\r\n  Cap. All things that we ordained festival\r\n    Turn from their office to black funeral-\r\n    Our instruments to melancholy bells,\r\n    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;\r\n    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;\r\n    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;\r\n    And all things change them to the contrary.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;\r\n    And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare\r\n    To follow this fair corse unto her grave.\r\n    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;\r\n    Move them no more by crossing their high will.\r\n                           Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].\r\n  1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.\r\n\r\n  Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!\r\n    For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]\r\n  1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.\r\n\r\n                         Enter Peter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!\r\n    O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'\r\n  1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',\r\n\r\n  Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is\r\n    full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.\r\n  1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.\r\n\r\n  Pet. You will not then?\r\n  1. Mus. No.\r\n\r\n  Pet. I will then give it you soundly.\r\n  1. Mus. What will you give us?\r\n\r\n  Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the\r\n     minstrel.\r\n  1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.\r\n\r\n  Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.\r\n    I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you\r\n    note me?\r\n  1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.\r\n  2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.\r\n\r\n  Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an\r\n    iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.\r\n\r\n           'When griping grief the heart doth wound,\r\n             And doleful dumps the mind oppress,\r\n           Then music with her silver sound'-\r\n\r\n    Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?\r\n    What say you, Simon Catling?\r\n  1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.\r\n\r\n  Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?\r\n  2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.\r\n\r\n  Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?\r\n  3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.\r\n\r\n  Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It\r\n    is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no\r\n    gold for sounding.\r\n\r\n           'Then music with her silver sound\r\n             With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.\r\n\r\n  1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?\r\n  2. Mus. Hang him, Jack!

A street.\r\n\r\nEnter Romeo.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep\r\n    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.\r\n    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,\r\n    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit\r\n    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.\r\n    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead\r\n    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)\r\n    And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips\r\n    That I reviv'd and was an emperor.\r\n    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,\r\n    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!\r\n\r\n                Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.\r\n\r\n    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?\r\n    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?\r\n    How doth my lady? Is my father well?\r\n    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,\r\n    For nothing can be ill if she be well.\r\n\r\n  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.\r\n    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,\r\n    And her immortal part with angels lives.\r\n    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault\r\n    And presently took post to tell it you.\r\n    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,\r\n    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!\r\n    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper\r\n    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.\r\n\r\n  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.\r\n    Your looks are pale and wild and do import\r\n    Some misadventure.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.\r\n    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.\r\n    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?\r\n\r\n  Man. No, my good lord.\r\n\r\n  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone\r\n    And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.\r\n                                               Exit [Balthasar].\r\n    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.\r\n    Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift\r\n    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!\r\n    I do remember an apothecary,\r\n    And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted\r\n    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,\r\n    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,\r\n    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;\r\n    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\r\n    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins\r\n    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\r\n    A beggarly account of empty boxes,\r\n    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\r\n    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\r\n    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.\r\n    Noting this penury, to myself I said,\r\n    'An if a man did need a poison now\r\n    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,\r\n    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'\r\n    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,\r\n    And this same needy man must sell it me.\r\n    As I remember, this should be the house.\r\n    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!\r\n\r\n                        Enter Apothecary.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Apoth. Who calls so loud?\r\n\r\n  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\r\n    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\r\n    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\r\n    As will disperse itself through all the veins\r\n    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,\r\n    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath\r\n    As violently as hasty powder fir'd\r\n    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.\r\n\r\n  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law\r\n    Is death to any he that utters them.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness\r\n    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\r\n    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\r\n    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:\r\n    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;\r\n    The world affords no law to make thee rich;\r\n    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.\r\n\r\n  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.\r\n\r\n  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will\r\n    And drink it off, and if you had the strength\r\n    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.\r\n\r\n  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,\r\n    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,\r\n    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\r\n    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.\r\n    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.\r\n    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me\r\n    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.\r\n                                                         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene II.\r\nVerona. Friar Laurence's cell.\r\n\r\nEnter Friar John to Friar Laurence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!\r\n\r\n                      Enter Friar Laurence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.\r\n    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?\r\n    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.\r\n\r\n  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,\r\n    One of our order, to associate me\r\n    Here in this city visiting the sick,\r\n    And finding him, the searchers of the town,\r\n    Suspecting that we both were in a house\r\n    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,\r\n    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,\r\n    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.\r\n\r\n  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?\r\n\r\n  John. I could not send it- here it is again-\r\n    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,\r\n    So fearful were they of infection.\r\n\r\n  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\r\n    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,\r\n    Of dear import; and the neglecting it\r\n    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,\r\n    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight\r\n    Unto my cell.\r\n\r\n  John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.\r\n\r\n  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.\r\n    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.\r\n    She will beshrew me much that Romeo\r\n    Hath had no notice of these accidents;\r\n    But I will write again to Mantua,\r\n    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-\r\n    Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScene III.\r\nVerona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.\r\n\r\nEnter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].\r\n\r\n\r\n  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.\r\n    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.\r\n    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,\r\n    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.\r\n    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread\r\n    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)\r\n    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,\r\n    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.\r\n    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.\r\n\r\n  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone\r\n    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]\r\n\r\n  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew\r\n    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)\r\n    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;\r\n    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.\r\n    The obsequies that I for thee will keep\r\n    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.\r\n                                                    Whistle Boy.\r\n    The boy gives warning something doth approach.\r\n    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night\r\n    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?\r\n    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]\r\n\r\n       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,\r\n                    and a crow of iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\r\n    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning\r\n    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.\r\n    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,\r\n    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof\r\n    And do not interrupt me in my course.\r\n    Why I descend into this bed of death\r\n    Is partly to behold my lady's face,\r\n    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\r\n    A precious ring- a ring that I must use\r\n    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.\r\n    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry\r\n    In what I farther shall intend to do,\r\n    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint\r\n    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\r\n    The time and my intents are savage-wild,\r\n    More fierce and more inexorable far\r\n    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.\r\n\r\n  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\r\n\r\n  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\r\n    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.\r\n\r\n  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.\r\n    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]\r\n\r\n  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\r\n    Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,\r\n    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\r\n    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.\r\n                                           Romeo opens the tomb.\r\n\r\n  Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague\r\n    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief\r\n    It is supposed the fair creature died-\r\n    And here is come to do some villanous shame\r\n    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\r\n    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!\r\n    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?\r\n    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\r\n    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.\r\n\r\n  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.\r\n    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.\r\n    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;\r\n    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\r\n    But not another sin upon my head\r\n    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!\r\n    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,\r\n    For I come hither arm'd against myself.\r\n    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say\r\n    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.\r\n\r\n  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration\r\n    And apprehend thee for a felon here.\r\n\r\n  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!\r\n                                                     They fight.\r\n\r\n  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.\r\n                                            [Exit. Paris falls.]\r\n\r\n  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,\r\n    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]\r\n\r\n  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.\r\n    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!\r\n    What said my man when my betossed soul\r\n    Did not attend him as we rode? I think\r\n    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.\r\n    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?\r\n    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet\r\n    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,\r\n    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!\r\n    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.\r\n    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,\r\n    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\r\n    This vault a feasting presence full of light.\r\n    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.\r\n                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]\r\n    How oft when men are at the point of death\r\n    Have they been merry! which their keepers call\r\n    A lightning before death. O, how may I\r\n    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!\r\n    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,\r\n    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\r\n    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet\r\n    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\r\n    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.\r\n    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\r\n    O, what more favour can I do to thee\r\n    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\r\n    To sunder his that was thine enemy?\r\n    Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,\r\n    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\r\n    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,\r\n    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps\r\n    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?\r\n    For fear of that I still will stay with thee\r\n    And never from this palace of dim night\r\n    Depart again. Here, here will I remain\r\n    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\r\n    Will I set up my everlasting rest\r\n    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\r\n    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!\r\n    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you\r\n    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\r\n    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!\r\n    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!\r\n    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on\r\n    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!\r\n    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!\r\n    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.\r\n\r\n    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night\r\n    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?\r\n\r\n  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,\r\n    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light\r\n    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\r\n    It burneth in the Capels' monument.\r\n\r\n  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,\r\n    One that you love.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Who is it?\r\n\r\n  Bal. Romeo.\r\n\r\n  Friar. How long hath he been there?\r\n\r\n  Bal. Full half an hour.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Go with me to the vault.\r\n\r\n  Bal. I dare not, sir.\r\n    My master knows not but I am gone hence,\r\n    And fearfully did menace me with death\r\n    If I did stay to look on his intents.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\r\n    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.\r\n\r\n  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,\r\n    I dreamt my master and another fought,\r\n    And that my master slew him.\r\n\r\n  Friar. Romeo!\r\n    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains\r\n    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?\r\n    What mean these masterless and gory swords\r\n    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]\r\n    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\r\n    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour\r\n    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.\r\n                                                   Juliet rises.\r\n\r\n  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?\r\n    I do remember well where I should be,\r\n    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?\r\n\r\n  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest\r\n    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\r\n    A greater power than we can contradict\r\n    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\r\n    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;\r\n    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee\r\n    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.\r\n    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.\r\n    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\r\n\r\n  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.\r\n                                                   Exit [Friar].\r\n    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?\r\n    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.\r\n    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop\r\n    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.\r\n    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them\r\n    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]\r\n    Thy lips are warm!\r\n\r\n  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?\r\n    Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!\r\n                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]\r\n    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.\r\n                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].\r\n\r\n                Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.\r\n\r\n  Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.\r\n    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.\r\n                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]\r\n    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;\r\n    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\r\n    Who here hath lain this two days buried.\r\n    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;\r\n    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.\r\n                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]\r\n    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\r\n    But the true ground of all these piteous woes\r\n    We cannot without circumstance descry.\r\n\r\n     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].\r\n\r\n  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.\r\n\r\n  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\r\n\r\n          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.\r\n\r\n  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\r\n    We took this mattock and this spade from him\r\n    As he was coming from this churchyard side.\r\n\r\n  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.\r\n\r\n              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].\r\n\r\n\r\n  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,\r\n    That calls our person from our morning rest?\r\n\r\n            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?\r\n\r\n  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'\r\n    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,\r\n    With open outcry, toward our monument.\r\n\r\n  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?\r\n\r\n  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;\r\n    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,\r\n    Warm and new kill'd.\r\n\r\n  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\r\n\r\n  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,\r\n    With instruments upon them fit to open\r\n    These dead men's tombs.\r\n\r\n  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\r\n    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house\r\n    Is empty on the back of Montague,\r\n    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!\r\n\r\n  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell\r\n    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.\r\n\r\n               Enter Montague [and others].\r\n\r\n\r\n  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up\r\n    To see thy son and heir more early down.\r\n\r\n  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!\r\n    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.\r\n    What further woe conspires against mine age?\r\n\r\n  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.\r\n\r\n  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,\r\n    To press before thy father to a grave?\r\n\r\n  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\r\n    Till we can clear these ambiguities\r\n    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;\r\n    And then will I be general of your woes\r\n    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\r\n    And let mischance be slave to patience.\r\n    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.\r\n\r\n  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,\r\n    Yet most suspected, as the time and place\r\n    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;\r\n    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge\r\n    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.\r\n\r\n  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.\r\n\r\n  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath\r\n    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.\r\n    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;\r\n    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.\r\n    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day\r\n    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death\r\n    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;\r\n    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.\r\n    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,\r\n    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce\r\n    To County Paris. Then comes she to me\r\n    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean\r\n    To rid her from this second marriage,\r\n    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.\r\n    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)\r\n    A sleeping potion; which so took effect\r\n    As I intended, for it wrought on her\r\n    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\r\n    That he should hither come as this dire night\r\n    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,\r\n    Being the time the potion's force should cease.\r\n    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,\r\n    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight\r\n    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone\r\n    At the prefixed hour of her waking\r\n    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;\r\n    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell\r\n    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.\r\n    But when I came, some minute ere the time\r\n    Of her awaking, here untimely lay\r\n    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\r\n    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth\r\n    And bear this work of heaven with patience;\r\n    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\r\n    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,\r\n    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.\r\n    All this I know, and to the marriage\r\n    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this\r\n    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life\r\n    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,\r\n    Unto the rigour of severest law.\r\n\r\n  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.\r\n    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?\r\n\r\n  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;\r\n    And then in post he came from Mantua\r\n    To this same place, to this same monument.\r\n    This letter he early bid me give his father,\r\n    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,\r\n    If I departed not and left him there.\r\n\r\n  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.\r\n    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?\r\n    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?\r\n\r\n  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;\r\n    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\r\n    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\r\n    And by-and-by my master drew on him;\r\n    And then I ran away to call the watch.\r\n\r\n  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,\r\n    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;\r\n    And here he writes that he did buy a poison\r\n    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal\r\n    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\r\n    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,\r\n    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\r\n    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\r\n    And I, for winking at you, discords too,\r\n    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.\r\n\r\n  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.\r\n    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more\r\n    Can I demand.\r\n\r\n  Mon. But I can give thee more;\r\n    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,\r\n    That whiles Verona by that name is known,\r\n    There shall no figure at such rate be set\r\n    As that of true and faithful Juliet.\r\n\r\n  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-\r\n    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!\r\n\r\n  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\r\n    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.\r\n    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\r\n    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;\r\n    For never was a story of more woe\r\n    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.\r\n                                                   Exeunt omnes.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROMEO AND JULIET ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1112.txt or 1112.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/1/1112/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"},{"filename":"The Taming of the Shrew.txt","text":"ï»¿THE TAMING OF THE SHREW\r\n\r\nby William Shakespeare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDramatis Personae\r\n\r\n    Persons in the Induction\r\n  A LORD\r\n  CHRISTOPHER SLY, a tinker\r\n  HOSTESS\r\n  PAGE\r\n  PLAYERS\r\n  HUNTSMEN\r\n  SERVANTS\r\n\r\n  BAPTISTA MINOLA, a gentleman of Padua\r\n  VINCENTIO, a Merchant of Pisa\r\n  LUCENTIO, son to Vincentio, in love with Bianca\r\n  PETRUCHIO, a gentleman of Verona, a suitor to Katherina\r\n\r\n    Suitors to Bianca\r\n  GREMIO\r\n  HORTENSIO\r\n\r\n    Servants to Lucentio\r\n  TRANIO\r\n  BIONDELLO\r\n\r\n    Servants to Petruchio\r\n  GRUMIO\r\n  CURTIS\r\n\r\n  A PEDANT\r\n\r\n    Daughters to Baptista\r\n  KATHERINA, the shrew\r\n  BIANCA\r\n\r\n  A WIDOW\r\n\r\n  Tailor, Haberdasher, and Servants attending on Baptista and\r\n    Petruchio\r\n\r\n                             SCENE:\r\n            Padua, and PETRUCHIO'S house in the country\r\n\r\nSC_1\r\n                      INDUCTION.

Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;\r\n    Brach Merriman, the poor cur, is emboss'd;\r\n    And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.\r\n    Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good\r\n    At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?\r\n    I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.\r\n  FIRST HUNTSMAN. Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;\r\n    He cried upon it at the merest loss,\r\n    And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent;\r\n    Trust me, I take him for the better dog.\r\n  LORD. Thou art a fool; if Echo were as fleet,\r\n    I would esteem him worth a dozen such.\r\n    But sup them well, and look unto them all;\r\n    To-morrow I intend to hunt again.\r\n  FIRST HUNTSMAN. I will, my lord.\r\n  LORD. What's here? One dead, or drunk?\r\n    See, doth he breathe?\r\n  SECOND HUNTSMAN. He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with\r\nale,\r\n    This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.\r\n  LORD. O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!\r\n    Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!\r\n    Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.\r\n    What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,\r\n    Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,\r\n    A most delicious banquet by his bed,\r\n    And brave attendants near him when he wakes,\r\n    Would not the beggar then forget himself?\r\n  FIRST HUNTSMAN. Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.\r\n  SECOND HUNTSMAN. It would seem strange unto him when he wak'd.\r\n  LORD. Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.\r\n    Then take him up, and manage well the jest:\r\n    Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,\r\n    And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;\r\n    Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,\r\n    And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;\r\n    Procure me music ready when he wakes,\r\n    To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;\r\n    And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,\r\n    And with a low submissive reverence\r\n    Say 'What is it your honour will command?'\r\n    Let one attend him with a silver basin\r\n    Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers;\r\n    Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,\r\n    And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'\r\n    Some one be ready with a costly suit,\r\n    And ask him what apparel he will wear;\r\n    Another tell him of his hounds and horse,\r\n    And that his lady mourns at his disease;\r\n    Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,\r\n    And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,\r\n    For he is nothing but a mighty lord.\r\n    This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;\r\n    It will be pastime passing excellent,\r\n    If it be husbanded with modesty.\r\n  FIRST HUNTSMAN. My lord, I warrant you we will play our part\r\n    As he shall think by our true diligence\r\n    He is no less than what we say he is.\r\n  LORD.

Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll\r\nwear,\r\n    for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings\r\nthan\r\n    legs, nor no more shoes than feet- nay, sometime more feet\r\nthan\r\n    shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.\r\n  LORD.

And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee\r\n    Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,\r\n    She was the fairest creature in the world;\r\n    And yet she is inferior to none.\r\n  SLY. Am I a lord and have I such a lady?\r\n    Or do I dream? Or have I dream'd till now?\r\n    I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;\r\n    I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things.\r\n    Upon my life, I am a lord indeed,\r\n    And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.\r\n    Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;\r\n    And once again, a pot o' th' smallest ale.\r\n  SECOND SERVANT. Will't please your Mightiness to wash your\r\nhands?\r\n    O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!\r\n    O, that once more you knew but what you are!\r\n    These fifteen years you have been in a dream;\r\n    Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.\r\n  SLY. These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.\r\n    But did I never speak of all that time?\r\n  FIRST SERVANT. O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;\r\n    For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,\r\n    Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;\r\n    And rail upon the hostess of the house,\r\n    And say you would present her at the leet,\r\n    Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts.\r\n    Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.\r\n  SLY. Ay, the woman's maid of the house.\r\n  THIRD SERVANT. Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,\r\n    Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,\r\n    As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,\r\n    And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;\r\n    And twenty more such names and men as these,\r\n    Which never were, nor no man ever saw.\r\n  SLY. Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!\r\n  ALL. Amen.\r\n\r\n           Enter the PAGE as a lady, with ATTENDANTS\r\n\r\n  SLY. I thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.\r\n  PAGE. How fares my noble lord?\r\n  SLY. Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.\r\n    Where is my wife?\r\n  PAGE. Here, noble lord; what is thy will with her?\r\n  SLY. Are you my wife, and will not call me husband?\r\n    My men should call me 'lord'; I am your goodman.\r\n  PAGE. My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;\r\n    I am your wife in all obedience.\r\n  SLY. I know it well. What must I call her?\r\n  LORD. Madam.\r\n  SLY. Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?\r\n  LORD. Madam, and nothing else; so lords call ladies.\r\n  SLY. Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd\r\n    And slept above some fifteen year or more.\r\n  PAGE. Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,\r\n    Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.\r\n  SLY. 'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.\r\n                                                 Exeunt SERVANTS\r\n    Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.\r\n  PAGE. Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you\r\n    To pardon me yet for a night or two;\r\n    Or, if not so, until the sun be set.\r\n    For your physicians have expressly charg'd,\r\n    In peril to incur your former malady,\r\n    That I should yet absent me from your bed.\r\n    I hope this reason stands for my excuse.\r\n  SLY. Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long. But I\r\nwould\r\n    be loath to fall into my dreams again. I will therefore tarry\r\nin\r\n    despite of the flesh and the blood.\r\n\r\n                       Enter a MESSENGER\r\n\r\n  MESSENGER. Your honour's players, hearing your amendment,\r\n    Are come to play a pleasant comedy;\r\n    For so your doctors hold it very meet,\r\n    Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,\r\n    And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.\r\n    Therefore they thought it good you hear a play\r\n    And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,\r\n    Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.\r\n  SLY. Marry, I will; let them play it. Is not a comonty a\r\n    Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?\r\n  PAGE. No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.\r\n  SLY. What, household stuff?\r\n  PAGE. It is a kind of history.\r\n  SLY. Well, we'll see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and\r\nlet\r\n    the world slip;-we shall ne'er be younger.\r\n                                                 [They sit down]\r\n\r\n          A flourish of trumpets announces the play\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

A public place\r\n\r\nEnter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO\r\n\r\n  LUCENTIO. Tranio, since for the great desire I had\r\n    To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,\r\n    I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy,\r\n    The pleasant garden of great Italy,\r\n    And by my father's love and leave am arm'd\r\n    With his good will and thy good company,\r\n    My trusty servant well approv'd in all,\r\n    Here let us breathe, and haply institute\r\n    A course of learning and ingenious studies.\r\n    Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,\r\n    Gave me my being and my father first,\r\n    A merchant of great traffic through the world,\r\n    Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;\r\n    Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,\r\n    It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,\r\n    To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.\r\n    And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,\r\n    Virtue and that part of philosophy\r\n    Will I apply that treats of happiness\r\n    By virtue specially to be achiev'd.\r\n    Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left\r\n    And am to Padua come as he that leaves\r\n    A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,\r\n    And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.\r\n  TRANIO. Mi perdonato, gentle master mine;\r\n    I am in all affected as yourself;\r\n    Glad that you thus continue your resolve\r\n    To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.\r\n    Only, good master, while we do admire\r\n    This virtue and this moral discipline,\r\n    Let's be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray,\r\n    Or so devote to Aristotle's checks\r\n    As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.\r\n    Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,\r\n    And practise rhetoric in your common talk;\r\n    Music and poesy use to quicken you;\r\n    The mathematics and the metaphysics,\r\n    Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.\r\n    No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;\r\n    In brief, sir, study what you most affect.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.\r\n    If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,\r\n    We could at once put us in readiness,\r\n    And take a lodging fit to entertain\r\n    Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.\r\n\r\n      Enter BAPTISTA with his two daughters, KATHERINA\r\n        and BIANCA; GREMIO, a pantaloon; HORTENSIO,\r\n        suitor to BIANCA. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by\r\n\r\n    But stay awhile; what company is this?\r\n  TRANIO. Master, some show to welcome us to town.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, importune me no farther,\r\n    For how I firmly am resolv'd you know;\r\n    That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter\r\n    Before I have a husband for the elder.\r\n    If either of you both love Katherina,\r\n    Because I know you well and love you well,\r\n    Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.\r\n  GREMIO. To cart her rather. She's too rough for me.\r\n    There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?\r\n  KATHERINA.  [To BAPTISTA]  I pray you, sir, is it your will\r\n    To make a stale of me amongst these mates?\r\n  HORTENSIO. Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,\r\n    Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.\r\n  KATHERINA. I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;\r\n    Iwis it is not halfway to her heart;\r\n    But if it were, doubt not her care should be\r\n    To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,\r\n    And paint your face, and use you like a fool.\r\n  HORTENSIO. From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!\r\n  GREMIO. And me, too, good Lord!\r\n  TRANIO. Husht, master! Here's some good pastime toward;\r\n    That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.\r\n  LUCENTIO. But in the other's silence do I see\r\n    Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.\r\n    Peace, Tranio!\r\n  TRANIO. Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, that I may soon make good\r\n    What I have said- Bianca, get you in;\r\n    And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,\r\n    For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.\r\n  KATHERINA. A pretty peat! it is best\r\n    Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.\r\n  BIANCA. Sister, content you in my discontent.\r\n    Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe;\r\n    My books and instruments shall be my company,\r\n    On them to look, and practise by myself.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak!\r\n  HORTENSIO. Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?\r\n    Sorry am I that our good will effects\r\n    Bianca's grief.\r\n  GREMIO. Why will you mew her up,\r\n    Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,\r\n    And make her bear the penance of her tongue?\r\n  BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.\r\n    Go in, Bianca.                                   Exit BIANCA\r\n    And for I know she taketh most delight\r\n    In music, instruments, and poetry,\r\n    Schoolmasters will I keep within my house\r\n    Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,\r\n    Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,\r\n    Prefer them hither; for to cunning men\r\n    I will be very kind, and liberal\r\n    To mine own children in good bringing-up;\r\n    And so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;\r\n    For I have more to commune with Bianca.                 Exit\r\n  KATHERINA. Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?\r\n    What! shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike,\r\n    I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!          Exit\r\n  GREMIO. You may go to the devil's dam; your gifts are so good\r\n    here's none will hold you. There! Love is not so great,\r\n    Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it\r\nfairly\r\n    out; our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell; yet, for the\r\nlove\r\n    I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit\r\nman\r\n    to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to\r\nher\r\n    father.\r\n  HORTENSIO. SO Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray.\r\nThough\r\n    the nature of our quarrel yet never brook'd parle, know now,\r\nupon\r\n    advice, it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have\r\naccess to\r\n    our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca's love- to\r\n    labour and effect one thing specially.\r\n  GREMIO. What's that, I pray?\r\n  HORTENSIO. Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.\r\n  GREMIO. A husband? a devil.\r\n  HORTENSIO. I say a husband.\r\n  GREMIO. I say a devil. Think'st thou, Hortensio, though her\r\nfather\r\n    be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to\r\nhell?\r\n  HORTENSIO. Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine\r\nto\r\n    endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in\r\nthe\r\n    world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all\r\n    faults, and money enough.\r\n  GREMIO. I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with\r\nthis\r\n    condition: to be whipp'd at the high cross every morning.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten\r\n    apples. But, come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it\r\n    shall be so far forth friendly maintain'd till by helping\r\n    Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest\r\nfree\r\n    for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy\r\nman\r\n    be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you,\r\n    Signior Gremio?\r\n  GREMIO. I am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse\r\nin\r\n    Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed\r\nher,\r\n    and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.\r\n                                     Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO\r\n  TRANIO. I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible\r\n    That love should of a sudden take such hold?\r\n  LUCENTIO. O Tranio, till I found it to be true,\r\n    I never thought it possible or likely.\r\n    But see! while idly I stood looking on,\r\n    I found the effect of love in idleness;\r\n    And now in plainness do confess to thee,\r\n    That art to me as secret and as dear\r\n    As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was-\r\n    Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,\r\n    If I achieve not this young modest girl.\r\n    Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;\r\n    Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.\r\n  TRANIO. Master, it is no time to chide you now;\r\n    Affection is not rated from the heart;\r\n    If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so:\r\n    'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'\r\n  LUCENTIO. Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;\r\n    The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.\r\n  TRANIO. Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.\r\n    Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.\r\n  LUCENTIO. O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,\r\n    Such as the daughter of Agenor had,\r\n    That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,\r\n    When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.\r\n  TRANIO. Saw you no more? Mark'd you not how her sister\r\n    Began to scold and raise up such a storm\r\n    That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?\r\n  LUCENTIO. Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,\r\n    And with her breath she did perfume the air;\r\n    Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.\r\n  TRANIO. Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.\r\n    I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,\r\n    Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:\r\n    Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd\r\n    That, till the father rid his hands of her,\r\n    Master, your love must live a maid at home;\r\n    And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,\r\n    Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!\r\n    But art thou not advis'd he took some care\r\n    To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?\r\n  TRANIO. Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.\r\n  LUCENTIO. I have it, Tranio.\r\n  TRANIO. Master, for my hand,\r\n    Both our inventions meet and jump in one.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Tell me thine first.\r\n  TRANIO. You will be schoolmaster,\r\n    And undertake the teaching of the maid-\r\n    That's your device.\r\n  LUCENTIO. It is. May it be done?\r\n  TRANIO. Not possible; for who shall bear your part\r\n    And be in Padua here Vincentio's son;\r\n    Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,\r\n    Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?\r\n  LUCENTIO. Basta, content thee, for I have it full.\r\n    We have not yet been seen in any house,\r\n    Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces\r\n    For man or master. Then it follows thus:\r\n    Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,\r\n    Keep house and port and servants, as I should;\r\n    I will some other be- some Florentine,\r\n    Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.\r\n    'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once\r\n    Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.\r\n    When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;\r\n    But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.\r\n  TRANIO. So had you need.                [They exchange habits]\r\n    In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,\r\n    And I am tied to be obedient-\r\n    For so your father charg'd me at our parting:\r\n    'Be serviceable to my son' quoth he,\r\n    Although I think 'twas in another sense-\r\n    I am content to be Lucentio,\r\n    Because so well I love Lucentio.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Tranio, be so because Lucentio loves;\r\n    And let me be a slave t' achieve that maid\r\n    Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.\r\n\r\n                       Enter BIONDELLO.\r\n\r\n    Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?\r\n  BIONDELLO. Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?\r\n    Master, has my fellow Tranio stol'n your clothes?\r\n    Or you stol'n his? or both? Pray, what's the news?\r\n  LUCENTIO. Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,\r\n    And therefore frame your manners to the time.\r\n    Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,\r\n    Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,\r\n    And I for my escape have put on his;\r\n    For in a quarrel since I came ashore\r\n    I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried.\r\n    Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,\r\n    While I make way from hence to save my life.\r\n    You understand me?\r\n  BIONDELLO. I, sir? Ne'er a whit.\r\n  LUCENTIO. And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:\r\n    Tranio is chang'd into Lucentio.\r\n  BIONDELLO. The better for him; would I were so too!\r\n  TRANIO. So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,\r\n    That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.\r\n    But, sirrah, not for my sake but your master's, I advise\r\n    You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.\r\n    When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;\r\n    But in all places else your master Lucentio.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Tranio, let's go.\r\n    One thing more rests, that thyself execute-\r\n    To make one among these wooers. If thou ask me why-\r\n    Sufficeth, my reasons are both good and weighty.      Exeunt\r\n\r\n                 The Presenters above speak\r\n\r\n  FIRST SERVANT. My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.\r\n  SLY. Yes, by Saint Anne do I. A good matter, surely; comes\r\nthere\r\n    any more of it?\r\n  PAGE. My lord, 'tis but begun.\r\n  SLY. 'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady\r\n    Would 'twere done!                        [They sit and mark]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\nPadua. Before HORTENSIO'S house\r\n\r\nEnter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO\r\n\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Verona, for a while I take my leave,\r\n    To see my friends in Padua; but of all\r\n    My best beloved and approved friend,\r\n    Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.\r\n    Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.\r\n GRUMIO. Knock, sir! Whom should I knock?\r\n    Is there any man has rebus'd your worship?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.\r\n  GRUMIO. Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I\r\n    should knock you here, sir?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Villain, I say, knock me at this gate,\r\n    And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.\r\n  GRUMIO. My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you\r\nfirst,\r\n    And then I know after who comes by the worst.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Will it not be?\r\n    Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock I'll ring it;\r\n    I'll try how you can sol-fa, and sing it.\r\n                                     [He wrings him by the ears]\r\n  GRUMIO. Help, masters, help! My master is mad.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!\r\n\r\n                        Enter HORTENSIO\r\n\r\n  HORTENSIO. How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and\r\nmy\r\n    good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?\r\n    'Con tutto il cuore ben trovato' may I say.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Alla nostra casa ben venuto,\r\n    Molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.\r\n    Rise, Grumio, rise; we will compound this quarrel.\r\n  GRUMIO. Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. If\r\nthis\r\n    be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service- look you,\r\nsir:\r\n    he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it\r\nfit\r\n    for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught\r\nI\r\n    see, two and thirty, a pip out?\r\n    Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,\r\n    Then had not Grumio come by the worst.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,\r\n    I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,\r\n    And could not get him for my heart to do it.\r\n  GRUMIO. Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words\r\n    plain: 'Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and\r\n    knock me soundly'? And come you now with 'knocking at the\r\ngate'?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge;\r\n    Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,\r\n    Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.\r\n    And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale\r\n    Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Such wind as scatters young men through the world\r\n    To seek their fortunes farther than at home,\r\n    Where small experience grows. But in a few,\r\n    Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:\r\n    Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,\r\n    And I have thrust myself into this maze,\r\n    Haply to wive and thrive as best I may;\r\n    Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,\r\n    And so am come abroad to see the world.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee\r\n    And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?\r\n    Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel,\r\n    And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,\r\n    And very rich; but th'art too much my friend,\r\n    And I'll not wish thee to her.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we\r\n    Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know\r\n    One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,\r\n    As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,\r\n    Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,\r\n    As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd\r\n    As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse-\r\n    She moves me not, or not removes, at least,\r\n    Affection's edge in me, were she as rough\r\n    As are the swelling Adriatic seas.\r\n    I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;\r\n    If wealthily, then happily in Padua.\r\n  GRUMIO. Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind\r\nis.\r\n    Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an\r\n    aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head,\r\nthough\r\n    she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why,\r\nnothing\r\n    comes amiss, so money comes withal.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,\r\n    I will continue that I broach'd in jest.\r\n    I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife\r\n    With wealth enough, and young and beauteous;\r\n    Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;\r\n    Her only fault, and that is faults enough,\r\n    Is- that she is intolerable curst,\r\n    And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure\r\n    That, were my state far worser than it is,\r\n    I would not wed her for a mine of gold.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect.\r\n    Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;\r\n    For I will board her though she chide as loud\r\n    As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Her father is Baptista Minola,\r\n    An affable and courteous gentleman;\r\n    Her name is Katherina Minola,\r\n    Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I know her father, though I know not her;\r\n    And he knew my deceased father well.\r\n    I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;\r\n    And therefore let me be thus bold with you\r\n    To give you over at this first encounter,\r\n    Unless you will accompany me thither.\r\n  GRUMIO. I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O'\r\nmy\r\n    word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think\r\nscolding\r\n    would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half\r\na\r\n    score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; and he begin once,\r\nhe'll\r\n    rail in his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what, sir: an she\r\nstand\r\n    him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so\r\n    disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see\r\n    withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,\r\n    For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.\r\n    He hath the jewel of my life in hold,\r\n    His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca;\r\n    And her withholds from me, and other more,\r\n    Suitors to her and rivals in my love;\r\n    Supposing it a thing impossible-\r\n    For those defects I have before rehears'd-\r\n    That ever Katherina will be woo'd.\r\n    Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,\r\n    That none shall have access unto Bianca\r\n    Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.\r\n  GRUMIO. Katherine the curst!\r\n    A title for a maid of all titles the worst.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,\r\n    And offer me disguis'd in sober robes\r\n    To old Baptista as a schoolmaster\r\n    Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;\r\n    That so I may by this device at least\r\n    Have leave and leisure to make love to her,\r\n    And unsuspected court her by herself.\r\n\r\n        Enter GREMIO with LUCENTIO disguised as CAMBIO\r\n\r\n  GRUMIO. Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how\r\nthe\r\n    young folks lay their heads together! Master, master, look\r\nabout\r\n    you. Who goes there, ha?\r\n  HORTENSIO. Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love.\r\nPetruchio,\r\n    stand by awhile.\r\n  GRUMIO. A proper stripling, and an amorous!\r\n                                              [They stand aside]\r\n  GREMIO. O, very well; I have perus'd the note.\r\n    Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound-\r\n    All books of love, see that at any hand;\r\n    And see you read no other lectures to her.\r\n    You understand me- over and beside\r\n    Signior Baptista's liberality,\r\n    I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,\r\n    And let me have them very well perfum'd;\r\n    For she is sweeter than perfume itself\r\n    To whom they go to. What will you read to her?\r\n  LUCENTIO. Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you\r\n    As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,\r\n    As firmly as yourself were still in place;\r\n    Yea, and perhaps with more successful words\r\n    Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.\r\n  GREMIO. O this learning, what a thing it is!\r\n  GRUMIO. O this woodcock, what an ass it is!\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Peace, sirrah!\r\n  HORTENSIO. Grumio, mum!                       [Coming forward]\r\n    God save you, Signior Gremio!\r\n  GREMIO. And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.\r\n    Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.\r\n    I promis'd to enquire carefully\r\n    About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;\r\n    And by good fortune I have lighted well\r\n    On this young man; for learning and behaviour\r\n    Fit for her turn, well read in poetry\r\n    And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.\r\n  HORTENSIO. 'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman\r\n    Hath promis'd me to help me to another,\r\n    A fine musician to instruct our mistress;\r\n    So shall I no whit be behind in duty\r\n    To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.\r\n  GREMIO. Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove.\r\n  GRUMIO. And that his bags shall prove.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.\r\n    Listen to me, and if you speak me fair\r\n    I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.\r\n    Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,\r\n    Upon agreement from us to his liking,\r\n    Will undertake to woo curst Katherine;\r\n    Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.\r\n  GREMIO. So said, so done, is well.\r\n    Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I know she is an irksome brawling scold;\r\n    If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.\r\n  GREMIO. No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.\r\n    My father dead, my fortune lives for me;\r\n    And I do hope good days and long to see.\r\n  GREMIO. O Sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!\r\n    But if you have a stomach, to't a God's name;\r\n    You shall have me assisting you in all.\r\n    But will you woo this wild-cat?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Will I live?\r\n  GRUMIO. Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why came I hither but to that intent?\r\n    Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?\r\n    Have I not in my time heard lions roar?\r\n    Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,\r\n    Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?\r\n    Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,\r\n    And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?\r\n    Have I not in a pitched battle heard\r\n    Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?\r\n    And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,\r\n    That gives not half so great a blow to hear\r\n    As will a chestnut in a fariner's fire?\r\n    Tush! tush! fear boys with bugs.\r\n  GRUMIO. For he fears none.\r\n  GREMIO. Hortensio, hark:\r\n    This gentleman is happily arriv'd,\r\n    My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.\r\n  HORTENSIO. I promis'd we would be contributors\r\n    And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.\r\n  GREMIO. And so we will- provided that he win her.\r\n  GRUMIO. I would I were as sure of a good dinner.\r\n\r\n    Enter TRANIO, bravely apparelled as LUCENTIO, and BIONDELLO\r\n\r\n  TRANIO. Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,\r\n    Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way\r\n    To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?\r\n  BIONDELLO. He that has the two fair daughters; is't he you\r\nmean?\r\n  TRANIO. Even he, Biondello.\r\n  GREMIO. Hark you, sir, you mean not her to-\r\n  TRANIO. Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.\r\n  TRANIO. I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.\r\n  LUCENTIO.  [Aside]  Well begun, Tranio.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Sir, a word ere you go.\r\n    Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?\r\n  TRANIO. And if I be, sir, is it any offence?\r\n  GREMIO. No; if without more words you will get you hence.\r\n  TRANIO. Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free\r\n    For me as for you?\r\n  GREMIO. But so is not she.\r\n\r\n  TRANIO. For what reason, I beseech you?\r\n  GREMIO. For this reason, if you'll know,\r\n    That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.\r\n  HORTENSIO. That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.\r\n  TRANIO. Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,\r\n    Do me this right- hear me with patience.\r\n    Baptista is a noble gentleman,\r\n    To whom my father is not all unknown,\r\n    And, were his daughter fairer than she is,\r\n    She may more suitors have, and me for one.\r\n    Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;\r\n    Then well one more may fair Bianca have;\r\n    And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,\r\n    Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.\r\n  GREMIO. What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!\r\n  LUCENTIO. Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Hortensio, to what end are all these words?\r\n  HORTENSIO. Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,\r\n    Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?\r\n  TRANIO. No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:\r\n    The one as famous for a scolding tongue\r\n    As is the other for beauteous modesty.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.\r\n  GREMIO. Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,\r\n    And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:\r\n    The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,\r\n    Her father keeps from all access of suitors,\r\n    And will not promise her to any man\r\n    Until the elder sister first be wed.\r\n    The younger then is free, and not before.\r\n  TRANIO. If it be so, sir, that you are the man\r\n    Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;\r\n    And if you break the ice, and do this feat,\r\n    Achieve the elder, set the younger free\r\n    For our access- whose hap shall be to have her\r\n    Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;\r\n    And since you do profess to be a suitor,\r\n    You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,\r\n    To whom we all rest generally beholding.\r\n  TRANIO. Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,\r\n    Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,\r\n    And quaff carouses to our mistress' health;\r\n    And do as adversaries do in law-\r\n    Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.\r\n  GRUMIO, BIONDELLO. O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.\r\n  HORTENSIO. The motion's good indeed, and be it so.\r\n    Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.

BAPTISTA'S house\r\n\r\nEnter KATHERINA and BIANCA\r\n\r\n  BIANCA. Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,\r\n    To make a bondmaid and a slave of me-\r\n    That I disdain; but for these other gawds,\r\n    Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,\r\n    Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;\r\n    Or what you will command me will I do,\r\n    So well I know my duty to my elders.\r\n  KATHERINA. Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell\r\n    Whom thou lov'st best. See thou dissemble not.\r\n  BIANCA. Believe me, sister, of all the men alive\r\n    I never yet beheld that special face\r\n    Which I could fancy more than any other.\r\n  KATHERINA. Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?\r\n  BIANCA. If you affect him, sister, here I swear\r\n    I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him.\r\n  KATHERINA. O then, belike, you fancy riches more:\r\n    You will have Gremio to keep you fair.\r\n  BIANCA. Is it for him you do envy me so?\r\n    Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive\r\n    You have but jested with me all this while.\r\n    I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.\r\n  KATHERINA. [Strikes her]  If that be jest, then an the rest was\r\nso.\r\n\r\n                            Enter BAPTISTA\r\n\r\n  BAPTISTA. Why, how now, dame! Whence grows this insolence?\r\n    Bianca, stand aside- poor girl! she weeps.\r\n                                                [He unbinds her]\r\n    Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.\r\n    For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,\r\n    Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?\r\n    When did she cross thee with a bitter word?\r\n  KATHERINA. Her silence flouts me, and I'll be reveng'd.\r\n                                            [Flies after BIANCA]\r\n  BAPTISTA. What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.\r\n                                                     Exit BIANCA\r\n  KATHERINA. What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see\r\n    She is your treasure, she must have a husband;\r\n    I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day,\r\n    And for your love to her lead apes in hell.\r\n    Talk not to me; I will go sit and weep,\r\n    Till I can find occasion of revenge.          Exit KATHERINA\r\n  BAPTISTA. Was ever gentleman thus griev'd as I?\r\n    But who comes here?\r\n\r\n        Enter GREMIO, with LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man;\r\n         PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO,\r\n    as LUCENTIO, with his boy, BIONDELLO, bearing a lute and\r\nbooks\r\n\r\n  GREMIO. Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.\r\n    God save you, gentlemen!\r\n  PETRUCHIO. And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter\r\n    Call'd Katherina, fair and virtuous?\r\n  BAPTISTA. I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katherina.\r\n  GREMIO. You are too blunt; go to it orderly.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. You wrong me, Signior Gremio; give me leave.\r\n    I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,\r\n    That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,\r\n    Her affability and bashful modesty,\r\n    Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,\r\n    Am bold to show myself a forward guest\r\n    Within your house, to make mine eye the witness\r\n    Of that report which I so oft have heard.\r\n    And, for an entrance to my entertainment,\r\n    I do present you with a man of mine,\r\n                                          [Presenting HORTENSIO]\r\n    Cunning in music and the mathematics,\r\n    To instruct her fully in those sciences,\r\n    Whereof I know she is not ignorant.\r\n    Accept of him, or else you do me wrong-\r\n    His name is Licio, born in Mantua.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Y'are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;\r\n    But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,\r\n    She is not for your turn, the more my grief.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I see you do not mean to part with her;\r\n    Or else you like not of my company.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.\r\n    Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,\r\n    A man well known throughout all Italy.\r\n  BAPTISTA. I know him well; you are welcome for his sake.\r\n  GREMIO. Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,\r\n    Let us that are poor petitioners speak too.\r\n    Bacare! you are marvellous forward.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. O, pardon me, Signior Gremio! I would fain be doing.\r\n  GREMIO. I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.\r\n    Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To\r\n    express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly\r\n    beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young\r\n    scholar  [Presenting LUCENTIO]  that hath been long studying\r\nat\r\n    Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as\r\nthe\r\n    other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray\r\naccept\r\n    his service.\r\n  BAPTISTA. A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good\r\nCambio.\r\n    [To TRANIO]  But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a\r\nstranger.\r\n    May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?\r\n  TRANIO. Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own\r\n    That, being a stranger in this city here,\r\n    Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,\r\n    Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.\r\n    Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me\r\n    In the preferment of the eldest sister.\r\n    This liberty is all that I request-\r\n    That, upon knowledge of my parentage,\r\n    I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,\r\n    And free access and favour as the rest.\r\n    And toward the education of your daughters\r\n    I here bestow a simple instrument,\r\n    And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.\r\n    If you accept them, then their worth is great.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Lucentio is your name? Of whence, I pray?\r\n  TRANIO. Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.\r\n  BAPTISTA. A mighty man of Pisa. By report\r\n    I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.\r\n    Take you the lute, and you the set of books;\r\n    You shall go see your pupils presently.\r\n    Holla, within!\r\n\r\n                         Enter a SERVANT\r\n\r\n    Sirrah, lead these gentlemen\r\n    To my daughters; and tell them both\r\n    These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.\r\n\r\n                Exit SERVANT leading HORTENSIO carrying the lute\r\n                                     and LUCENTIO with the books\r\n\r\n    We will go walk a little in the orchard,\r\n    And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,\r\n    And so I pray you all to think yourselves.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,\r\n    And every day I cannot come to woo.\r\n    You knew my father well, and in him me,\r\n    Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,\r\n    Which I have bettered rather than decreas'd.\r\n    Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,\r\n    What dowry shall I have with her to wife?\r\n  BAPTISTA. After my death, the one half of my lands\r\n    And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. And for that dowry, I'll assure her of\r\n    Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,\r\n    In all my lands and leases whatsoever.\r\n    Let specialities be therefore drawn between us,\r\n    That covenants may be kept on either hand.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,\r\n    That is, her love; for that is all in all.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,\r\n    I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;\r\n    And where two raging fires meet together,\r\n    They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.\r\n    Though little fire grows great with little wind,\r\n    Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.\r\n    So I to her, and so she yields to me;\r\n    For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed\r\n    But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,\r\n    That shake not though they blow perpetually.\r\n\r\n             Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke\r\n\r\n  BAPTISTA. How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?\r\n  HORTENSIO. For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.\r\n  BAPTISTA. What, will my daughter prove a good musician?\r\n  HORTENSIO. I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:\r\n    Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?\r\n  HORTENSIO. Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.\r\n    I did but tell her she mistook her frets,\r\n    And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,\r\n    When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,\r\n    'Frets, call you these?' quoth she 'I'll fume with them.'\r\n    And with that word she struck me on the head,\r\n    And through the instrument my pate made way;\r\n    And there I stood amazed for a while,\r\n    As on a pillory, looking through the lute,\r\n    While she did call me rascal fiddler\r\n    And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,\r\n    As she had studied to misuse me so.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;\r\n    I love her ten times more than e'er I did.\r\n    O, how I long to have some chat with her!\r\n  BAPTISTA. Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;\r\n    Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;\r\n    She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.\r\n    Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,\r\n    Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I pray you do.             Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO\r\n    I'll attend her here,\r\n    And woo her with some spirit when she comes.\r\n    Say that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain\r\n    She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.\r\n    Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear\r\n    As morning roses newly wash'd with dew.\r\n    Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;\r\n    Then I'll commend her volubility,\r\n    And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.\r\n    If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,\r\n    As though she bid me stay by her a week;\r\n    If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day\r\n    When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.\r\n    But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.\r\n\r\n                        Enter KATHERINA\r\n\r\n    Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.\r\n  KATHERINA. Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:\r\n    They call me Katherine that do talk of me.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,\r\n    And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;\r\n    But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,\r\n    Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,\r\n    For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,\r\n    Take this of me, Kate of my consolation-\r\n    Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,\r\n    Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,\r\n    Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,\r\n    Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.\r\n  KATHERINA. Mov'd! in good time! Let him that mov'd you hither\r\n    Remove you hence. I knew you at the first\r\n    You were a moveable.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, what's a moveable?\r\n  KATHERINA. A join'd-stool.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.\r\n  KATHERINA. Asses are made to bear, and so are you.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Women are made to bear, and so are you.\r\n  KATHERINA. No such jade as you, if me you mean.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee!\r\n    For, knowing thee to be but young and light-\r\n  KATHERINA. Too light for such a swain as you to catch;\r\n    And yet as heavy as my weight should be.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Should be! should- buzz!\r\n  KATHERINA. Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. O, slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?\r\n  KATHERINA. Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.\r\n  KATHERINA. If I be waspish, best beware my sting.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. My remedy is then to pluck it out.\r\n  KATHERINA. Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?\r\n    In his tail.\r\n  KATHERINA. In his tongue.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Whose tongue?\r\n  KATHERINA. Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,\r\n    Good Kate; I am a gentleman.\r\n  KATHERINA. That I'll try.                    [She strikes him]\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.\r\n  KATHERINA. So may you lose your arms.\r\n    If you strike me, you are no gentleman;\r\n    And if no gentleman, why then no arms.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!\r\n  KATHERINA. What is your crest- a coxcomb?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.\r\n  KATHERINA. No cock of mine: you crow too like a craven.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.\r\n  KATHERINA. It is my fashion, when I see a crab.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.\r\n  KATHERINA. There is, there is.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Then show it me.\r\n  KATHERINA. Had I a glass I would.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. What, you mean my face?\r\n  KATHERINA. Well aim'd of such a young one.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.\r\n  KATHERINA. Yet you are wither'd.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. 'Tis with cares.\r\n  KATHERINA. I care not.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.\r\n  KATHERINA. I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.\r\n    'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,\r\n    And now I find report a very liar;\r\n    For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,\r\n    But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.\r\n    Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,\r\n    Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,\r\n    Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;\r\n    But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers;\r\n    With gentle conference, soft and affable.\r\n    Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?\r\n    O sland'rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig\r\n    Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue\r\n    As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.\r\n    O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.\r\n  KATHERINA. Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Did ever Dian so become a grove\r\n    As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?\r\n    O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;\r\n    And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!\r\n  KATHERINA. Where did you study all this goodly speech?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. It is extempore, from my mother wit.\r\n  KATHERINA. A witty mother! witless else her son.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Am I not wise?\r\n  KATHERINA. Yes, keep you warm.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.\r\n    And therefore, setting all this chat aside,\r\n    Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented\r\n    That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on;\r\n    And will you, nill you, I will marry you.\r\n    Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;\r\n    For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,\r\n    Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,\r\n    Thou must be married to no man but me;\r\n    For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,\r\n    And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate\r\n    Conformable as other household Kates.\r\n\r\n               Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO\r\n\r\n    Here comes your father. Never make denial;\r\n    I must and will have Katherine to my wife.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my\r\ndaughter?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. How but well, sir? how but well?\r\n    It were impossible I should speed amiss.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?\r\n  KATHERINA. Call you me daughter? Now I promise you\r\n    You have show'd a tender fatherly regard\r\n    To wish me wed to one half lunatic,\r\n    A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,\r\n    That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world\r\n    That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.\r\n    If she be curst, it is for policy,\r\n    For,she's not froward, but modest as the dove;\r\n    She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;\r\n    For patience she will prove a second Grissel,\r\n    And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.\r\n    And, to conclude, we have 'greed so well together\r\n    That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.\r\n  KATHERINA. I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.\r\n  GREMIO. Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee hang'd first.\r\n  TRANIO. Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;\r\n    If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?\r\n    'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,\r\n    That she shall still be curst in company.\r\n    I tell you 'tis incredible to believe.\r\n    How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!\r\n    She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss\r\n    She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,\r\n    That in a twink she won me to her love.\r\n    O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see,\r\n    How tame, when men and women are alone,\r\n    A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.\r\n    Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,\r\n    To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.\r\n    Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;\r\n    I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.\r\n  BAPTISTA. I know not what to say; but give me your hands.\r\n    God send you joy, Petruchio! 'Tis a match.\r\n  GREMIO, TRANIO. Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.\r\n    I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;\r\n    We will have rings and things, and fine array;\r\n    And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.\r\n                        Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA severally\r\n  GREMIO. Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?\r\n  BAPTISTA. Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,\r\n    And venture madly on a desperate mart.\r\n  TRANIO. 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;\r\n    'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.\r\n  BAPTISTA. The gain I seek is quiet in the match.\r\n  GREMIO. No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.\r\n    But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:\r\n    Now is the day we long have looked for;\r\n    I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.\r\n  TRANIO. And I am one that love Bianca more\r\n    Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.\r\n  GREMIO. Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.\r\n  TRANIO. Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.\r\n  GREMIO. But thine doth fry.\r\n    Skipper, stand back; 'tis age that nourisheth.\r\n  TRANIO. But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Content you, gentlemen; I will compound this strife.\r\n    'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both\r\n    That can assure my daughter greatest dower\r\n    Shall have my Bianca's love.\r\n    Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?\r\n  GREMIO. First, as you know, my house within the city\r\n    Is richly furnished with plate and gold,\r\n    Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;\r\n    My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;\r\n    In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;\r\n    In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,\r\n    Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,\r\n    Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,\r\n    Valance of Venice gold in needle-work;\r\n    Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs\r\n    To house or housekeeping. Then at my farm\r\n    I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,\r\n    Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,\r\n    And all things answerable to this portion.\r\n    Myself am struck in years, I must confess;\r\n    And if I die to-morrow this is hers,\r\n    If whilst I live she will be only mine.\r\n  TRANIO. That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:\r\n    I am my father's heir and only son;\r\n    If I may have your daughter to my wife,\r\n    I'll leave her houses three or four as good\r\n    Within rich Pisa's walls as any one\r\n    Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;\r\n    Besides two thousand ducats by the year\r\n    Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.\r\n    What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?\r\n  GREMIO. Two thousand ducats by the year of land!\r\n    [Aside]  My land amounts not to so much in all.-\r\n    That she shall have, besides an argosy\r\n    That now is lying in Marseilles road.\r\n    What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?\r\n  TRANIO. Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less\r\n    Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,\r\n    And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,\r\n    And twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next.\r\n  GREMIO. Nay, I have off'red all; I have no more;\r\n    And she can have no more than all I have;\r\n    If you like me, she shall have me and mine.\r\n  TRANIO. Why, then the maid is mine from all the world\r\n    By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.\r\n  BAPTISTA. I must confess your offer is the best;\r\n    And let your father make her the assurance,\r\n    She is your own. Else, you must pardon me;\r\n    If you should die before him, where's her dower?\r\n  TRANIO. That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.\r\n  GREMIO. And may not young men die as well as old?\r\n  BAPTISTA. Well, gentlemen,\r\n    I am thus resolv'd: on Sunday next you know\r\n    My daughter Katherine is to be married;\r\n    Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca\r\n    Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;\r\n    If not, to Signior Gremio.\r\n    And so I take my leave, and thank you both.\r\n  GREMIO. Adieu, good neighbour.                   Exit BAPTISTA\r\n    Now, I fear thee not.\r\n    Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool\r\n    To give thee all, and in his waning age\r\n    Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!\r\n    An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.              Exit\r\n  TRANIO. A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!\r\n    Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten.\r\n    'Tis in my head to do my master good:\r\n    I see no reason but suppos'd Lucentio\r\n    Must get a father, call'd suppos'd Vincentio;\r\n    And that's a wonder- fathers commonly\r\n    Do get their children; but in this case of wooing\r\n    A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.\r\n Exit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

BAPTISTA'S house\r\n\r\nEnter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, HORTENSIO as LICIO, and BIANCA\r\n\r\n  LUCENTIO. Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir.\r\n    Have you so soon forgot the entertainment\r\n    Her sister Katherine welcome'd you withal?\r\n  HORTENSIO. But, wrangling pedant, this is\r\n    The patroness of heavenly harmony.\r\n    Then give me leave to have prerogative;\r\n    And when in music we have spent an hour,\r\n    Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Preposterous ass, that never read so far\r\n    To know the cause why music was ordain'd!\r\n    Was it not to refresh the mind of man\r\n    After his studies or his usual pain?\r\n    Then give me leave to read philosophy,\r\n    And while I pause serve in your harmony.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.\r\n  BIANCA. Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong\r\n    To strive for that which resteth in my choice.\r\n    I arn no breeching scholar in the schools,\r\n    I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,\r\n    But learn my lessons as I please myself.\r\n    And to cut off all strife: here sit we down;\r\n    Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!\r\n    His lecture will be done ere you have tun'd.\r\n  HORTENSIO. You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?\r\n  LUCENTIO. That will be never- tune your instrument.\r\n  BIANCA. Where left we last?\r\n  LUCENTIO. Here, madam:\r\n    'Hic ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus,\r\n    Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'\r\n  BIANCA. Construe them.\r\n  LUCENTIO. 'Hic ibat' as I told you before- 'Simois' I am\r\nLucentio-\r\n    'hic est' son unto Vincentio of Pisa- 'Sigeia tellus'\r\ndisguised\r\n    thus to get your love- 'Hic steterat' and that Lucentio that\r\n    comes a-wooing- 'Priami' is my man Tranio- 'regia' bearing my\r\n    port- 'celsa senis' that we might beguile the old pantaloon.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Madam, my instrument's in tune.\r\n  BIANCA. Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.\r\n  BIANCA. Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat Simois'\r\nI\r\n    know you not- 'hic est Sigeia tellus' I trust you not- 'Hic\r\n    steterat Priami' take heed he hear us not- 'regia' presume\r\nnot-\r\n   'celsa senis' despair not.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Madam, 'tis now in tune.\r\n  LUCENTIO. All but the bass.\r\n  HORTENSIO. The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.\r\n    [Aside]  How fiery and forward our pedant is!\r\n    Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.\r\n    Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.\r\n  BIANCA. In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Mistrust it not- for sure, AEacides\r\n    Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.\r\n  BIANCA. I must believe my master; else, I promise you,\r\n    I should be arguing still upon that doubt;\r\n    But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.\r\n    Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,\r\n    That I have been thus pleasant with you both.\r\n  HORTENSIO.  [To LUCENTIO]  You may go walk and give me leave\r\n      awhile;\r\n    My lessons make no music in three Parts.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait,\r\n    [Aside]  And watch withal; for, but I be deceiv'd,\r\n    Our fine musician groweth amorous.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Madam, before you touch the instrument\r\n    To learn the order of my fingering,\r\n    I must begin with rudiments of art,\r\n    To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,\r\n    More pleasant, pithy, and effectual,\r\n    Than hath been taught by any of my trade;\r\n    And there it is in writing fairly drawn.\r\n  BIANCA. Why, I am past my gamut long ago.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.\r\n  BIANCA.  [Reads]\r\n         '\"Gamut\" I am, the ground of all accord-\r\n         \"A re\" to plead Hortensio's passion-\r\n         \"B mi\" Bianca, take him for thy lord-\r\n         \"C fa ut\" that loves with all affection-\r\n         \"D sol re\" one clef, two notes have I-\r\n         \"E la mi\" show pity or I die.'\r\n    Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not!\r\n    Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice\r\n    To change true rules for odd inventions.\r\n\r\n                       Enter a SERVANT\r\n\r\n  SERVANT. Mistress, your father prays you leave your books\r\n    And help to dress your sister's chamber up.\r\n    You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.\r\n  BIANCA. Farewell, sweet masters, both; I must be gone.\r\n                                       Exeunt BIANCA and SERVANT\r\n  LUCENTIO. Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.\r\n Exit\r\n  HORTENSIO. But I have cause to pry into this pedant;\r\n    Methinks he looks as though he were in love.\r\n    Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble\r\n    To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale-\r\n    Seize thee that list. If once I find thee ranging,\r\n  HORTENSIO will be quit with thee by changing.             Exit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\nPadua. Before BAPTISTA'S house\r\n\r\nEnter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO as LUCENTIO, KATHERINA, BIANCA,\r\nLUCENTIO as CAMBIO, and ATTENDANTS\r\n\r\n  BAPTISTA.  [To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed\r\nday\r\n    That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,\r\n    And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.\r\n    What will be said? What mockery will it be\r\n    To want the bridegroom when the priest attends\r\n    To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!\r\n    What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?\r\n  KATHERINA. No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc'd\r\n    To give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,\r\n    Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,\r\n    Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.\r\n    I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,\r\n    Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;\r\n    And, to be noted for a merry man,\r\n    He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,\r\n    Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns;\r\n    Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.\r\n    Now must the world point at poor Katherine,\r\n    And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,\r\n    If it would please him come and marry her!'\r\n  TRANIO. Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.\r\n    Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,\r\n    Whatever fortune stays him from his word.\r\n    Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;\r\n    Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.\r\n  KATHERINA. Would Katherine had never seen him though!\r\n                    Exit, weeping, followed by BIANCA and others\r\n  BAPTISTA. Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,\r\n    For such an injury would vex a very saint;\r\n    Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.\r\n\r\n                           Enter BIONDELLO\r\n\r\n    Master, master! News, and such old news as you never heard\r\nof!\r\n  BAPTISTA. Is it new and old too? How may that be?\r\n  BIONDELLO. Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?\r\n  BAPTISTA. Is he come?\r\n  BIONDELLO. Why, no, sir.\r\n  BAPTISTA. What then?\r\n  BIONDELLO. He is coming.\r\n  BAPTISTA. When will he be here?\r\n  BIONDELLO. When he stands where I am and sees you there.\r\n  TRANIO. But, say, what to thine old news?\r\n  BIONDELLO. Why, Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old\r\n    jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turn'd; a pair of boots\r\n    that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another lac'd; an\r\nold\r\n    rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury, with a broken\r\nhilt,\r\n    and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipp'd, with\r\nan\r\n    old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides,\r\npossess'd\r\n    with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled\r\nwith\r\n    the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls,\r\nsped\r\n    with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives,\r\n    stark spoil'd with the staggers, begnawn with the bots,\r\nsway'd in\r\n    the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legg'd before, and with a\r\n    half-cheek'd bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather which,\r\n    being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often\r\n    burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times\r\npiec'd,\r\n    and a woman's crupper of velure, which hath two letters for\r\nher\r\n    name fairly set down in studs, and here and there piec'd with\r\n    pack-thread.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Who comes with him?\r\n  BIONDELLO. O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison'd\r\nlike\r\n    the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey\r\nboot-hose\r\n    on the other, gart'red with a red and blue list; an old hat,\r\nand\r\n    the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather; a\r\n    monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian\r\n    footboy or a gentleman's lackey.\r\n  TRANIO. 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;\r\n    Yet oftentimes lie goes but mean-apparell'd.\r\n  BAPTISTA. I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.\r\n  BIONDELLO. Why, sir, he comes not.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Didst thou not say he comes?\r\n  BIONDELLO. Who? that Petruchio came?\r\n  BAPTISTA. Ay, that Petruchio came.\r\n  BIONDELLO. No, sir; I say his horse comes with him on his back.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Why, that's all one.\r\n  BIONDELLO. Nay, by Saint Jamy,\r\n             I hold you a penny,\r\n             A horse and a man\r\n             Is more than one,\r\n             And yet not many.\r\n\r\n                  Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO\r\n\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Come, where be these gallants? Who's at home?\r\n  BAPTISTA. You are welcome, sir.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. And yet I come not well.\r\n  BAPTISTA. And yet you halt not.\r\n  TRANIO. Not so well apparell'd\r\n    As I wish you were.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Were it better, I should rush in thus.\r\n    But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?\r\n    How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown;\r\n    And wherefore gaze this goodly company\r\n    As if they saw some wondrous monument,\r\n    Some comet or unusual prodigy?\r\n  BAPTISTA. Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day.\r\n    First were we sad, fearing you would not come;\r\n    Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.\r\n    Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,\r\n    An eye-sore to our solemn festival!\r\n  TRANIO. And tell us what occasion of import\r\n    Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,\r\n    And sent you hither so unlike yourself?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear;\r\n    Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,\r\n    Though in some part enforced to digress,\r\n    Which at more leisure I will so excuse\r\n    As you shall well be satisfied withal.\r\n    But where is Kate? I stay too long from her;\r\n    The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.\r\n  TRANIO. See not your bride in these unreverent robes;\r\n    Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.\r\n  BAPTISTA. But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with\r\nwords;\r\n    To me she's married, not unto my clothes.\r\n    Could I repair what she will wear in me\r\n    As I can change these poor accoutrements,\r\n    'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.\r\n    But what a fool am I to chat with you,\r\n    When I should bid good-morrow to my bride\r\n    And seal the title with a lovely kiss!\r\n                                  Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO\r\n  TRANIO. He hath some meaning in his mad attire.\r\n    We will persuade him, be it possible,\r\n    To put on better ere he go to church.\r\n  BAPTISTA. I'll after him and see the event of this.\r\n              Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, BIONDELLO, and ATTENDENTS\r\n  TRANIO. But to her love concerneth us to ad\r\n    Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,\r\n    As I before imparted to your worship,\r\n    I am to get a man- whate'er he be\r\n    It skills not much; we'll fit him to our turn-\r\n    And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,\r\n    And make assurance here in Padua\r\n    Of greater sums than I have promised.\r\n    So shall you quietly enjoy your hope\r\n    And marry sweet Bianca with consent.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster\r\n    Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,\r\n    'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;\r\n    Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,\r\n    I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.\r\n  TRANIO. That by degrees we mean to look into\r\n    And watch our vantage in this business;\r\n    We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,\r\n    The narrow-prying father, Minola,\r\n    The quaint musician, amorous Licio-\r\n    All for my master's sake, Lucentio.\r\n\r\n                           Re-enter GREMIO\r\n\r\n    Signior Gremio, came you from the church?\r\n  GREMIO. As willingly as e'er I came from school.\r\n  TRANIO. And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?\r\n  GREMIO. A bridegroom, say you? 'Tis a groom indeed,\r\n    A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.\r\n  TRANIO. Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.\r\n  GREMIO. Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.\r\n  TRANIO. Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.\r\n  GREMIO. Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him!\r\n    I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest\r\n    Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,\r\n    'Ay, by gogs-wouns' quoth he, and swore so loud\r\n    That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;\r\n    And as he stoop'd again to take it up,\r\n    This mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff\r\n    That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.\r\n    'Now take them up,' quoth he 'if any list.'\r\n  TRANIO. What said the wench, when he rose again?\r\n  GREMIO. Trembled and shook, for why he stamp'd and swore\r\n    As if the vicar meant to cozen him.\r\n    But after many ceremonies done\r\n    He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if\r\n    He had been abroad, carousing to his mates\r\n    After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,\r\n    And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,\r\n    Having no other reason\r\n    But that his beard grew thin and hungerly\r\n    And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.\r\n    This done, he took the bride about the neck,\r\n    And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack\r\n    That at the parting all the church did echo.\r\n    And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;\r\n    And after me, I know, the rout is coming.\r\n    Such a mad marriage never was before.\r\n    Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.         [Music plays]\r\n\r\n       Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO,\r\n                         GRUMIO, and train\r\n\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.\r\n    I know you think to dine with me to-day,\r\n    And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer\r\n    But so it is- my haste doth call me hence,\r\n    And therefore here I mean to take my leave.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Is't possible you will away to-night?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I must away to-day before night come.\r\n    Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,\r\n    You would entreat me rather go than stay.\r\n    And, honest company, I thank you all\r\n    That have beheld me give away myself\r\n    To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.\r\n    Dine with my father, drink a health to me.\r\n    For I must hence; and farewell to you all.\r\n  TRANIO. Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. It may not be.\r\n  GREMIO. Let me entreat you.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. It cannot be.\r\n  KATHERINA. Let me entreat you.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I am content.\r\n  KATHERINA. Are you content to stay?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I am content you shall entreat me stay;\r\n    But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.\r\n  KATHERINA. Now, if you love me, stay.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Grumio, my horse.\r\n  GRUMIO. Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses.\r\n  KATHERINA. Nay, then,\r\n    Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;\r\n    No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.\r\n    The door is open, sir; there lies your way;\r\n    You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;\r\n    For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself.\r\n    'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom\r\n    That take it on you at the first so roundly.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. O Kate, content thee; prithee be not angry.\r\n  KATHERINA. I will be angry; what hast thou to do?\r\n    Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.\r\n  GREMIO. Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.\r\n  KATHERINA. Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.\r\n    I see a woman may be made a fool\r\n    If she had not a spirit to resist.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.\r\n    Obey the bride, you that attend on her;\r\n    Go to the feast, revel and domineer,\r\n    Carouse full measure to her maidenhead;\r\n    Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.\r\n    But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.\r\n    Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;\r\n    I will be master of what is mine own-\r\n    She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,\r\n    My household stuff, my field, my barn,\r\n    My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,\r\n    And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;\r\n    I'll bring mine action on the proudest he\r\n    That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,\r\n    Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;\r\n    Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.\r\n    Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate;\r\n    I'll buckler thee against a million.\r\n                         Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, and GRUMIO\r\n  BAPTISTA. Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.\r\n  GREMIO. Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.\r\n  TRANIO. Of all mad matches, never was the like.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?\r\n  BIANCA. That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.\r\n  GREMIO. I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom\r\nwants\r\n    For to supply the places at the table,\r\n    You know there wants no junkets at the feast.\r\n    Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place;\r\n    And let Bianca take her sister's room.\r\n  TRANIO. Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?\r\n  BAPTISTA. She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.\r\n                                                          Exeunt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

SCENE I.\r\nPETRUCHIO'S country house\r\n\r\nEnter GRUMIO\r\n\r\n  GRUMIO. Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and\r\nall\r\n    foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray'd? Was\r\n    ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they\r\nare\r\n    coming after to warm them. Now were not I a little pot and\r\nsoon\r\n    hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the\r\nroof\r\n    of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a\r\nfire to\r\n    thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for,\r\n    considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.\r\n    Holla, ho! Curtis!\r\n\r\n                            Enter CURTIS\r\n\r\n  CURTIS. Who is that calls so coldly?\r\n  GRUMIO. A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from\r\nmy\r\n    shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my\r\n    neck. A fire, good Curtis.\r\n  CURTIS. Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?\r\n  GRUMIO. O, ay, Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no\r\n    water.\r\n  CURTIS. Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?\r\n  GRUMIO. She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou\r\nknow'st\r\n    winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tam'd my old\r\n    master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.\r\n  CURTIS. Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.\r\n  GRUMIO. Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so\r\nlong\r\n    am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I\r\ncomplain\r\n    on thee to our mistress, whose hand- she being now at hand-\r\nthou\r\n    shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy\r\nhot\r\n    office?\r\n  CURTIS. I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?\r\n  GRUMIO. A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and\r\n    therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master\r\nand\r\n    mistress are almost frozen to death.\r\n  CURTIS. There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the\r\nnews?\r\n  GRUMIO. Why, 'Jack boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou\r\nwilt.\r\n  CURTIS. Come, you are so full of cony-catching!\r\n  GRUMIO. Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold.\r\n    Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm'd, rushes\r\n    strew'd, cobwebs swept, the serving-men in their new fustian,\r\n    their white stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment\r\non?\r\n    Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, the carpets\r\n    laid, and everything in order?\r\n  CURTIS. All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.\r\n  GRUMIO. First know my horse is tired; my master and mistress\r\nfall'n\r\n    out.\r\n  CURTIS. How?\r\n  GRUMIO. Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a\r\n    tale.\r\n  CURTIS. Let's ha't, good Grumio.\r\n  GRUMIO. Lend thine ear.\r\n  CURTIS. Here.\r\n  GRUMIO. There.                                  [Striking him]\r\n  CURTIS. This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.\r\n  GRUMIO. And therefore 'tis call'd a sensible tale; and this\r\ncuff\r\n    was but to knock at your car and beseech list'ning. Now I\r\nbegin:\r\n    Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind\r\nmy\r\n    mistress-\r\n  CURTIS. Both of one horse?\r\n  GRUMIO. What's that to thee?\r\n  CURTIS. Why, a horse.\r\n  GRUMIO. Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not cross'd me, thou\r\n    shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her\r\nhorse;\r\n    thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was\r\n    bemoil'd, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he\r\nbeat me\r\n    because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to\r\n    pluck him off me, how he swore, how she pray'd that never\r\npray'd\r\n    before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle\r\nwas\r\n    burst, how I lost my crupper- with many things of worthy\r\nmemory,\r\n    which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return\r\nunexperienc'd to\r\n    thy grave.\r\n  CURTIS. By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.\r\n  GRUMIO. Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall\r\nfind\r\n    when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth\r\n    Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and\r\nthe\r\n    rest; let their heads be sleekly comb'd, their blue coats\r\nbrush'd\r\n    and their garters of an indifferent knit; let them curtsy\r\nwith\r\n    their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my\r\nmaster's\r\n    horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?\r\n  CURTIS. They are.\r\n  GRUMIO. Call them forth.\r\n  CURTIS. Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master, to\r\ncountenance my\r\n    mistress.\r\n  GRUMIO. Why, she hath a face of her own.\r\n  CURTIS. Who knows not that?\r\n  GRUMIO. Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance\r\nher.\r\n  CURTIS. I call them forth to credit her.\r\n  GRUMIO. Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.\r\n\r\n                     Enter four or five SERVINGMEN\r\n\r\n  NATHANIEL. Welcome home, Grumio!\r\n  PHILIP. How now, Grumio!\r\n  JOSEPH. What, Grumio!\r\n  NICHOLAS. Fellow Grumio!\r\n  NATHANIEL. How now, old lad!\r\n  GRUMIO. Welcome, you!- how now, you!- what, you!- fellow, you!-\r\nand\r\n    thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all\r\nready,\r\n    and all things neat?\r\n  NATHANIEL. All things is ready. How near is our master?\r\n  GRUMIO. E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not-\r\n   Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.\r\n\r\n                     Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA\r\n\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Where be these knaves? What, no man at door\r\n    To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!\r\n    Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?\r\n  ALL SERVANTS. Here, here, sir; here, sir.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!\r\n    You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!\r\n    What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?\r\n    Where is the foolish knave I sent before?\r\n  GRUMIO. Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. YOU peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!\r\n    Did I not bid thee meet me in the park\r\n    And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?\r\n  GRUMIO. Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,\r\n    And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' th' heel;\r\n    There was no link to colour Peter's hat,\r\n    And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing;\r\n    There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;\r\n    The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;\r\n    Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.\r\n                                   Exeunt some of the SERVINGMEN\r\n\r\n    [Sings]  Where is the life that late I led?\r\n             Where are those-\r\n\r\n    Sit down, Kate, and welcome. Soud, soud, soud, soud!\r\n\r\n                 Re-enter SERVANTS with supper\r\n\r\n    Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.\r\n    Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?\r\n\r\n    [Sings]  It was the friar of orders grey,\r\n             As he forth walked on his way-\r\n\r\n    Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry;\r\n    Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.\r\n                                                   [Strikes him]\r\n    Be merry, Kate. Some water, here, what, ho!\r\n\r\n                      Enter one with water\r\n\r\n    Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,\r\n    And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:\r\n                                                 Exit SERVINGMAN\r\n    One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.\r\n    Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?\r\n    Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.\r\n    You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?    [Strikes him]\r\n  KATHERINA. Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!\r\n    Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.\r\n    Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?\r\n    What's this? Mutton?\r\n  FIRST SERVANT. Ay.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Who brought it?\r\n  PETER. I.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. 'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.\r\n    What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?\r\n    How durst you villains bring it from the dresser\r\n    And serve it thus to me that love it not?\r\n    There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;\r\n                                [Throws the meat, etc., at them]\r\n    You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!\r\n    What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.\r\n                                                 Exeunt SERVANTS\r\n  KATHERINA. I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet;\r\n    The meat was well, if you were so contented.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,\r\n    And I expressly am forbid to touch it;\r\n    For it engenders choler, planteth anger;\r\n    And better 'twere that both of us did fast,\r\n    Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,\r\n    Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.\r\n    Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended.\r\n    And for this night we'll fast for company.\r\n    Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.        Exeunt\r\n\r\n                     Re-enter SERVANTS severally\r\n\r\n  NATHANIEL. Peter, didst ever see the like?\r\n  PETER. He kills her in her own humour.\r\n\r\n                            Re-enter CURTIS\r\n\r\n  GRUMIO. Where is he?\r\n  CURTIS. In her chamber. Making a sermon of continency to her,\r\n    And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,\r\n    Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.\r\n    And sits as one new risen from a dream.\r\n    Away, away! for he is coming hither.                  Exeunt\r\n\r\n                       Re-enter PETRUCHIO\r\n\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Thus have I politicly begun my reign,\r\n    And 'tis my hope to end successfully.\r\n    My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.\r\n    And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,\r\n    For then she never looks upon her lure.\r\n    Another way I have to man my haggard,\r\n    To make her come, and know her keeper's call,\r\n    That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites\r\n    That bate and beat, and will not be obedient.\r\n    She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;\r\n    Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;\r\n    As with the meat, some undeserved fault\r\n    I'll find about the making of the bed;\r\n    And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,\r\n    This way the coverlet, another way the sheets;\r\n    Ay, and amid this hurly I intend\r\n    That all is done in reverend care of her-\r\n    And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night;\r\n    And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl\r\n    And with the clamour keep her still awake.\r\n    This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,\r\n    And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.\r\n    He that knows better how to tame a shrew,\r\n    Now let him speak; 'tis charity to show.                Exit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\nPadua. Before BAPTISTA'S house\r\n\r\nEnter TRANIO as LUCENTIO, and HORTENSIO as LICIO\r\n\r\n  TRANIO. Is 't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca\r\n    Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?\r\n    I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,\r\n    Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.\r\n                                              [They stand aside]\r\n\r\n               Enter BIANCA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO\r\n\r\n  LUCENTIO. Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?\r\n  BIANCA. What, master, read you, First resolve me that.\r\n  LUCENTIO. I read that I profess, 'The Art to Love.'\r\n  BIANCA. And may you prove, sir, master of your art!\r\n  LUCENTIO. While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.\r\n                                                   [They retire]\r\n  HORTENSIO. Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,\r\n    You that durst swear that your Mistress Blanca\r\n    Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio.\r\n  TRANIO. O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!\r\n    I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Mistake no more; I am not Licio.\r\n    Nor a musician as I seem to be;\r\n    But one that scorn to live in this disguise\r\n    For such a one as leaves a gentleman\r\n    And makes a god of such a cullion.\r\n    Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.\r\n  TRANIO. Signior Hortensio, I have often heard\r\n    Of your entire affection to Bianca;\r\n    And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,\r\n    I will with you, if you be so contented,\r\n    Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.\r\n  HORTENSIO. See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,\r\n    Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow\r\n    Never to woo her more, but do forswear her,\r\n    As one unworthy all the former favours\r\n    That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.\r\n  TRANIO. And here I take the like unfeigned oath,\r\n    Never to marry with her though she would entreat;\r\n    Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!\r\n  HORTENSIO. Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!\r\n    For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,\r\n    I will be married to a wealthy widow\r\n    Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me\r\n    As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.\r\n    And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.\r\n    Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,\r\n    Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,\r\n    In resolution as I swore before.                        Exit\r\n  TRANIO. Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace\r\n    As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!\r\n    Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,\r\n    And have forsworn you with Hortensio.\r\n  BIANCA. Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?\r\n  TRANIO. Mistress, we have.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Then we are rid of Licio.\r\n  TRANIO. I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,\r\n    That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day.\r\n  BIANCA. God give him joy!\r\n  TRANIO. Ay, and he'll tame her.\r\n  BIANCA. He says so, Tranio.\r\n  TRANIO. Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.\r\n  BIANCA. The taming-school! What, is there such a place?\r\n  TRANIO. Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master,\r\n    That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,\r\n    To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.\r\n\r\n                       Enter BIONDELLO\r\n\r\n  BIONDELLO. O master, master, have watch'd so long\r\n    That I am dog-weary; but at last I spied\r\n    An ancient angel coming down the hill\r\n    Will serve the turn.\r\n  TRANIO. What is he, Biondello?\r\n  BIONDELLO. Master, a mercatante or a pedant,\r\n    I know not what; but formal in apparel,\r\n    In gait and countenance surely like a father.\r\n  LUCENTIO. And what of him, Tranio?\r\n  TRANIO. If he be credulous and trust my tale,\r\n    I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,\r\n    And give assurance to Baptista Minola\r\n    As if he were the right Vincentio.\r\n    Take in your love, and then let me alone.\r\n                                      Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA\r\n\r\n                         Enter a PEDANT\r\n\r\n  PEDANT. God save you, sir!\r\n  TRANIO. And you, sir; you are welcome.\r\n    Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?\r\n  PEDANT. Sir, at the farthest for a week or two;\r\n    But then up farther, and as far as Rome;\r\n    And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.\r\n  TRANIO. What countryman, I pray?\r\n  PEDANT. Of Mantua.\r\n  TRANIO. Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,\r\n    And come to Padua, careless of your life!\r\n  PEDANT. My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.\r\n  TRANIO. 'Tis death for any one in Mantua\r\n    To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?\r\n    Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the Duke,\r\n    For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,\r\n    Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.\r\n    'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,\r\n    You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.\r\n  PEDANT. Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so!\r\n    For I have bills for money by exchange\r\n    From Florence, and must here deliver them.\r\n  TRANIO. Well, sir, to do you courtesy,\r\n    This will I do, and this I will advise you-\r\n    First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?\r\n  PEDANT. Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,\r\n    Pisa renowned for grave citizens.\r\n  TRANIO. Among them know you one Vincentio?\r\n  PEDANT. I know him not, but I have heard of him,\r\n    A merchant of incomparable wealth.\r\n  TRANIO. He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,\r\n    In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you.\r\n  BIONDELLO.  [Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster, and\r\nall\r\n    one.\r\n  TRANIO. To save your life in this extremity,\r\n    This favour will I do you for his sake;\r\n    And think it not the worst of all your fortunes\r\n    That you are like to Sir Vincentio.\r\n    His name and credit shall you undertake,\r\n    And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd;\r\n    Look that you take upon you as you should.\r\n    You understand me, sir. So shall you stay\r\n    Till you have done your business in the city.\r\n    If this be court'sy, sir, accept of it.\r\n  PEDANT. O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever\r\n    The patron of my life and liberty.\r\n  TRANIO. Then go with me to make the matter good.\r\n    This, by the way, I let you understand:\r\n    My father is here look'd for every day\r\n    To pass assurance of a dow'r in marriage\r\n    'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.\r\n    In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.\r\n    Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.              Exeunt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\nPETRUCHIO'S house\r\n\r\nEnter KATHERINA and GRUMIO\r\n\r\n  GRUMIO. No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.\r\n  KATHERINA. The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.\r\n    What, did he marry me to famish me?\r\n    Beggars that come unto my father's door\r\n    Upon entreaty have a present alms;\r\n    If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;\r\n    But I, who never knew how to entreat,\r\n    Nor never needed that I should entreat,\r\n    Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;\r\n    With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;\r\n    And that which spites me more than all these wants-\r\n    He does it under name of perfect love;\r\n    As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,\r\n    'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.\r\n    I prithee go and get me some repast;\r\n    I care not what, so it be wholesome food.\r\n  GRUMIO. What say you to a neat's foot?\r\n  KATHERINA. 'Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.\r\n  GRUMIO. I fear it is too choleric a meat.\r\n    How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?\r\n  KATHERINA. I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.\r\n  GRUMIO. I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.\r\n    What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?\r\n  KATHERINA. A dish that I do love to feed upon.\r\n  GRUMIO. Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.\r\n  KATHERINA. Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.\r\n  GRUMIO. Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,\r\n    Or else you get no beef of Grumio.\r\n  KATHERINA. Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.\r\n  GRUMIO. Why then the mustard without the beef.\r\n  KATHERINA. Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,\r\n                                                     [Beats him]\r\n    That feed'st me with the very name of meat.\r\n    Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you\r\n    That triumph thus upon my misery!\r\n    Go, get thee gone, I say.\r\n\r\n               Enter PETRUCHIO, and HORTENSIO with meat\r\n\r\n  PETRUCHIO. How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?\r\n  HORTENSIO. Mistress, what cheer?\r\n  KATHERINA. Faith, as cold as can be.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.\r\n    Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,\r\n    To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee.\r\n    I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.\r\n    What, not a word? Nay, then thou lov'st it not,\r\n    And all my pains is sorted to no proof.\r\n    Here, take away this dish.\r\n  KATHERINA. I pray you, let it stand.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. The poorest service is repaid with thanks;\r\n    And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.\r\n  KATHERINA. I thank you, sir.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.\r\n    Come, Mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.\r\n  PETRUCHIO.  [Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest\r\nme.-\r\n    Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!\r\n    Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,\r\n    Will we return unto thy father's house\r\n    And revel it as bravely as the best,\r\n    With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,\r\n    With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things,\r\n    With scarfs and fans and double change of brav'ry.\r\n    With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry.\r\n    What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,\r\n    To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.\r\n\r\n                          Enter TAILOR\r\n\r\n    Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;\r\n    Lay forth the gown.\r\n\r\n                        Enter HABERDASHER\r\n\r\n    What news with you, sir?\r\n  HABERDASHER. Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, this was moulded on a porringer;\r\n    A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;\r\n    Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,\r\n    A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.\r\n    Away with it. Come, let me have a bigger.\r\n  KATHERINA. I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,\r\n    And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. When you are gentle, you shall have one too,\r\n    And not till then.\r\n  HORTENSIO.  [Aside]  That will not be in haste.\r\n  KATHERINA. Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;\r\n    And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.\r\n    Your betters have endur'd me say my mind,\r\n    And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.\r\n    My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,\r\n    Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;\r\n    And rather than it shall, I will be free\r\n    Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,\r\n    A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;\r\n    I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not.\r\n  KATHERINA. Love me or love me not, I like the cap;\r\n    And it I will have, or I will have none.    Exit HABERDASHER\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see't.\r\n    O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?\r\n    What's this? A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon.\r\n    What, up and down, carv'd like an appletart?\r\n    Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,\r\n    Like to a censer in a barber's shop.\r\n    Why, what a devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?\r\n  HORTENSIO.  [Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor\r\ngown.\r\n  TAILOR. You bid me make it orderly and well,\r\n    According to the fashion and the time.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Marry, and did; but if you be rememb'red,\r\n    I did not bid you mar it to the time.\r\n    Go, hop me over every kennel home,\r\n    For you shall hop without my custom, sir.\r\n    I'll none of it; hence! make your best of it.\r\n  KATHERINA. I never saw a better fashion'd gown,\r\n    More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;\r\n    Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.\r\n  TAILOR. She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou\r\n      thimble,\r\n    Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,\r\n    Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou-\r\n    Brav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread!\r\n    Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;\r\n    Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard\r\n    As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st!\r\n    I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.\r\n  TAILOR. Your worship is deceiv'd; the gown is made\r\n    Just as my master had direction.\r\n    Grumio gave order how it should be done.\r\n  GRUMIO. I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.\r\n  TAILOR. But how did you desire it should be made?\r\n  GRUMIO. Marry, sir, with needle and thread.\r\n  TAILOR. But did you not request to have it cut?\r\n  GRUMIO. Thou hast fac'd many things.\r\n  TAILOR. I have.\r\n  GRUMIO. Face not me. Thou hast brav'd many men; brave not me. I\r\n    will neither be fac'd nor brav'd. I say unto thee, I bid thy\r\n    master cut out the gown; but I did not bid him cut it to\r\npieces.\r\n    Ergo, thou liest.\r\n  TAILOR. Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Read it.\r\n  GRUMIO. The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.\r\n  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown'-\r\n  GRUMIO. Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the\r\n    skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown\r\nbread; I\r\n    said a gown.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Proceed.\r\n  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'With a small compass'd cape'-\r\n  GRUMIO. I confess the cape.\r\n  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve'-\r\n  GRUMIO. I confess two sleeves.\r\n  TAILOR.  [Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Ay, there's the villainy.\r\n  GRUMIO. Error i' th' bill, sir; error i' th' bill! I commanded\r\nthe\r\n    sleeves should be cut out, and sew'd up again; and that I'll\r\n    prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a\r\nthimble.\r\n  TAILOR. This is true that I say; an I had thee in place where,\r\nthou\r\n    shouldst know it.\r\n  GRUMIO. I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy\r\n    meteyard, and spare not me.\r\n  HORTENSIO. God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.\r\n  GRUMIO. You are i' th' right, sir; 'tis for my mistress.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Go, take it up unto thy master's use.\r\n  GRUMIO. Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress' gown\r\nfor\r\n    thy master's use!\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?\r\n  GRUMIO. O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.\r\n    Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!\r\n    O fie, fie, fie!\r\n  PETRUCHIO.  [Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor\r\npaid.-\r\n    Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow;\r\n    Take no unkindness of his hasty words.\r\n    Away, I say; commend me to thy master.           Exit TAILOR\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's\r\n    Even in these honest mean habiliments;\r\n    Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;\r\n    For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;\r\n    And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,\r\n    So honour peereth in the meanest habit.\r\n    What, is the jay more precious than the lark\r\n    Because his feathers are more beautiful?\r\n    Or is the adder better than the eel\r\n    Because his painted skin contents the eye?\r\n    O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse\r\n    For this poor furniture and mean array.\r\n    If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;\r\n    And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith\r\n    To feast and sport us at thy father's house.\r\n    Go call my men, and let us straight to him;\r\n    And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;\r\n    There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.\r\n    Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,\r\n    And well we may come there by dinner-time.\r\n  KATHERINA. I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,\r\n    And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. It shall be seven ere I go to horse.\r\n    Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,\r\n    You are still crossing it. Sirs, let 't alone;\r\n    I will not go to-day; and ere I do,\r\n    It shall be what o'clock I say it is.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Why, so this gallant will command the sun.\r\n                                                          Exeunt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.\r\nPadua. Before BAPTISTA'S house\r\n\r\nEnter TRANIO as LUCENTIO, and the PEDANT dressed like VINCENTIO\r\n\r\n  TRANIO. Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?\r\n  PEDANT. Ay, what else? And, but I be deceived,\r\n    Signior Baptista may remember me\r\n    Near twenty years ago in Genoa,\r\n    Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.\r\n  TRANIO. 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,\r\n    With such austerity as longeth to a father.\r\n\r\n                       Enter BIONDELLO\r\n\r\n  PEDANT. I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;\r\n    'Twere good he were school'd.\r\n  TRANIO. Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,\r\n    Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.\r\n    Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.\r\n  BIONDELLO. Tut, fear not me.\r\n  TRANIO. But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?\r\n  BIONDELLO. I told him that your father was at Venice,\r\n    And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.\r\n  TRANIO. Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.\r\n    Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.\r\n\r\n                 Enter BAPTISTA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO\r\n\r\n    Signior Baptista, you are happily met.\r\n    [To the PEDANT] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of;\r\n    I pray you stand good father to me now;\r\n    Give me Bianca for my patrimony.\r\n  PEDANT. Soft, son!\r\n    Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua\r\n    To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio\r\n    Made me acquainted with a weighty cause\r\n    Of love between your daughter and himself;\r\n    And- for the good report I hear of you,\r\n    And for the love he beareth to your daughter,\r\n    And she to him- to stay him not too long,\r\n    I am content, in a good father's care,\r\n    To have him match'd; and, if you please to like\r\n    No worse than I, upon some agreement\r\n    Me shall you find ready and willing\r\n    With one consent to have her so bestow'd;\r\n    For curious I cannot be with you,\r\n    Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.\r\n    Your plainness and your shortness please me well.\r\n    Right true it is your son Lucentio here\r\n    Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,\r\n    Or both dissemble deeply their affections;\r\n    And therefore, if you say no more than this,\r\n    That like a father you will deal with him,\r\n    And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,\r\n    The match is made, and all is done-\r\n    Your son shall have my daughter with consent.\r\n  TRANIO. I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best\r\n    We be affied, and such assurance ta'en\r\n    As shall with either part's agreement stand?\r\n  BAPTISTA. Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know\r\n    Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;\r\n    Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still,\r\n    And happily we might be interrupted.\r\n  TRANIO. Then at my lodging, an it like you.\r\n    There doth my father lie; and there this night\r\n    We'll pass the business privately and well.\r\n    Send for your daughter by your servant here;\r\n    My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.\r\n    The worst is this, that at so slender warning\r\n    You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.\r\n  BAPTISTA. It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,\r\n    And bid Bianca make her ready straight;\r\n    And, if you will, tell what hath happened-\r\n    Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua,\r\n    And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.      Exit LUCENTIO\r\n  BIONDELLO. I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.\r\n  TRANIO. Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.\r\n                                                  Exit BIONDELLO\r\n    Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?\r\n    Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer;\r\n    Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.\r\n  BAPTISTA. I follow you.                                 Exeunt\r\n\r\n            Re-enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, and BIONDELLO\r\n\r\n  BIONDELLO. Cambio.\r\n  LUCENTIO. What say'st thou, Biondello?\r\n  BIONDELLO. You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?\r\n  LUCENTIO. Biondello, what of that?\r\n  BIONDELLO. Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to\r\nexpound\r\n    the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.\r\n  LUCENTIO. I pray thee moralize them.\r\n  BIONDELLO. Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the\r\ndeceiving\r\n    father of a deceitful son.\r\n  LUCENTIO. And what of him?\r\n  BIONDELLO. His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.\r\n  LUCENTIO. And then?\r\n  BIONDELLO. The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your\r\ncommand\r\n    at all hours.\r\n  LUCENTIO. And what of all this?\r\n  BIONDELLO. I cannot tell, except they are busied about a\r\n    counterfeit assurance. Take your assurance of her, cum\r\nprivilegio\r\n    ad imprimendum solum; to th' church take the priest, clerk,\r\nand\r\n    some sufficient honest witnesses.\r\n    If this be not that you look for, I have more to say,\r\n    But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Hear'st thou, Biondello?\r\n  BIONDELLO. I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an\r\nafternoon\r\n    as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and\r\nso\r\n    may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me\r\nto\r\n    go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against\r\nyou\r\n    come with your appendix.\r\n Exit\r\n  LUCENTIO. I may and will, if she be so contented.\r\n    She will be pleas'd; then wherefore should I doubt?\r\n    Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her;\r\n    It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.              Exit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE V.\r\nA public road\r\n\r\nEnter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, HORTENSIO, and SERVANTS\r\n\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Come on, a God's name; once more toward our\r\nfather's.\r\n    Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!\r\n  KATHERINA. The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I say it is the moon that shines so bright.\r\n  KATHERINA. I know it is the sun that shines so bright.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Now by my mother's son, and that's myself,\r\n    It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,\r\n    Or ere I journey to your father's house.\r\n    Go on and fetch our horses back again.\r\n    Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!\r\n  HORTENSIO. Say as he says, or we shall never go.\r\n  KATHERINA. Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,\r\n    And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;\r\n    And if you please to call it a rush-candle,\r\n    Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I say it is the moon.\r\n  KATHERINA. I know it is the moon.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.\r\n  KATHERINA. Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun;\r\n    But sun it is not, when you say it is not;\r\n    And the moon changes even as your mind.\r\n    What you will have it nam'd, even that it is,\r\n    And so it shall be so for Katherine.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,\r\n    And not unluckily against the bias.\r\n    But, soft! Company is coming here.\r\n\r\n                            Enter VINCENTIO\r\n\r\n    [To VINCENTIO]  Good-morrow, gentle mistress; where away?-\r\n    Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,\r\n    Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?\r\n    Such war of white and red within her cheeks!\r\n    What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty\r\n    As those two eyes become that heavenly face?\r\n    Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.\r\n    Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.\r\n  HORTENSIO. 'A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.\r\n  KATHERINA. Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,\r\n    Whither away, or where is thy abode?\r\n    Happy the parents of so fair a child;\r\n    Happier the man whom favourable stars\r\n    Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad!\r\n    This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, withered,\r\n    And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.\r\n  KATHERINA. Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,\r\n    That have been so bedazzled with the sun\r\n    That everything I look on seemeth green;\r\n    Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.\r\n    Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known\r\n    Which way thou travellest- if along with us,\r\n    We shall be joyful of thy company.\r\n  VINCENTIO. Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,\r\n    That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me,\r\n    My name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,\r\n    And bound I am to Padua, there to visit\r\n    A son of mine, which long I have not seen.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. What is his name?\r\n  VINCENTIO. Lucentio, gentle sir.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Happily met; the happier for thy son.\r\n    And now by law, as well as reverend age,\r\n    I may entitle thee my loving father:\r\n    The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,\r\n    Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,\r\n    Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,\r\n    Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;\r\n    Beside, so qualified as may beseem\r\n    The spouse of any noble gentleman.\r\n    Let me embrace with old Vincentio;\r\n    And wander we to see thy honest son,\r\n    Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.\r\n  VINCENTIO. But is this true; or is it else your pleasure,\r\n    Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest\r\n    Upon the company you overtake?\r\n  HORTENSIO. I do assure thee, father, so it is.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;\r\n    For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.\r\n                                        Exeunt all but HORTENSIO\r\n  HORTENSIO. Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.\r\n    Have to my widow; and if she be froward,\r\n    Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.

Before LUCENTIO'S house\r\n\r\nEnter BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA; GREMIO is out before\r\n\r\n  BIONDELLO. Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.\r\n  LUCENTIO. I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need thee at\r\n    home, therefore leave us.\r\n  BIONDELLO. Nay, faith, I'll see the church a your back, and\r\nthen\r\n    come back to my master's as soon as I can.\r\n                          Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO\r\n  GREMIO. I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.\r\n\r\n           Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO,\r\n                          and ATTENDANTS\r\n\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Sir, here's the door; this is Lucentio's house;\r\n    My father's bears more toward the market-place;\r\n    Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.\r\n  VINCENTIO. You shall not choose but drink before you go;\r\n    I think I shall command your welcome here,\r\n    And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.         [Knocks]\r\n  GREMIO. They're busy within; you were best knock louder.\r\n                                [PEDANT looks out of the window]\r\n  PEDANT. What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?\r\n  VINCENTIO. Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?\r\n  PEDANT. He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.\r\n  VINCENTIO. What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to\r\nmake\r\n    merry withal?\r\n  PEDANT. Keep your hundred pounds to yourself; he shall need\r\nnone so\r\n    long as I live.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.\r\nDo\r\n    you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you\r\ntell\r\n    Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is\r\nhere\r\n    at the door to speak with him.\r\n  PEDANT. Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here\r\nlooking\r\n    out at the window.\r\n  VINCENTIO. Art thou his father?\r\n  PEDANT. Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.\r\n  PETRUCHIO.  [To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman!\r\n    Why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's\r\nname.\r\n  PEDANT. Lay hands on the villain; I believe 'a means to cozen\r\n    somebody in this city under my countenance.\r\n\r\n                       Re-enter BIONDELLO\r\n\r\n  BIONDELLO. I have seen them in the church together. God send\r\n'em\r\n    good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master, Vicentio!\r\nNow we\r\n    are undone and brought to nothing.\r\n  VINCENTIO.  [Seeing BIONDELLO]  Come hither, crack-hemp.\r\n  BIONDELLO. I hope I may choose, sir.\r\n  VINCENTIO. Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?\r\n  BIONDELLO. Forgot you! No, sir. I could not forget you, for I\r\nnever\r\n    saw you before in all my life.\r\n  VINCENTIO. What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see\r\nthy\r\n    master's father, Vincentio?\r\n  BIONDELLO. What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir;\r\nsee\r\n    where he looks out of the window.\r\n  VINCENTIO. Is't so, indeed?               [He beats BIONDELLO]\r\n  BIONDELLO. Help, help, help! Here's a madman will murder me.\r\n Exit\r\n  PEDANT. Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!     Exit from above\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of\r\nthis\r\n    controversy.                              [They stand aside]\r\n\r\n       Re-enter PEDANT below; BAPTISTA, TRANIO, and SERVANTS\r\n\r\n  TRANIO. Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?\r\n  VINCENTIO. What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir? O immortal\r\ngods!\r\n    O fine villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet\r\ncloak,\r\n    and a copatain hat! O, I am undone! I am undone! While I play\r\nthe\r\n    good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the\r\n    university.\r\n  TRANIO. How now! what's the matter?\r\n  BAPTISTA. What, is the man lunatic?\r\n  TRANIO. Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit,\r\nbut\r\n    your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if\r\nI\r\n    wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to\r\n    maintain it.\r\n  VINCENTIO. Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.\r\n  BAPTISTA. You mistake, sir; you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you\r\n\r\n    think is his name?\r\n  VINCENTIO. His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought\r\nhim\r\n    up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.\r\n  PEDANT. Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is\r\nmine\r\n    only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vicentio.\r\n  VINCENTIO. Lucentio! O, he hath murd'red his master! Lay hold\r\non\r\n    him, I charge you, in the Duke's name. O, my son, my son!\r\nTell\r\n    me, thou villain, where is my son, Lucentio?\r\n  TRANIO. Call forth an officer.\r\n\r\n                      Enter one with an OFFICER\r\n\r\n    Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, I charge\r\nyou\r\n    see that he be forthcoming.\r\n  VINCENTIO. Carry me to the gaol!\r\n  GREMIO. Stay, Officer; he shall not go to prison.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Talk not, Signior Gremio; I say he shall go to\r\nprison.\r\n  GREMIO. Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catch'd\r\nin\r\n    this business; I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.\r\n  PEDANT. Swear if thou dar'st.\r\n  GREMIO. Nay, I dare not swear it.\r\n  TRANIO. Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.\r\n  GREMIO. Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Away with the dotard; to the gaol with him!\r\n  VINCENTIO. Thus strangers may be hal'd and abus'd. O monstrous\r\n    villain!\r\n\r\n          Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA\r\n\r\n  BIONDELLO. O, we are spoil'd; and yonder he is! Deny him,\r\nforswear\r\n    him, or else we are all undone.\r\n         Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and PEDANT, as fast as may be\r\n  LUCENTIO.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.\r\n  VINCENTIO. Lives my sweet son?\r\n  BIANCA. Pardon, dear father.\r\n  BAPTISTA. How hast thou offended?\r\n    Where is Lucentio?\r\n  LUCENTIO. Here's Lucentio,\r\n    Right son to the right Vincentio,\r\n    That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,\r\n    While counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne.\r\n  GREMIO. Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!\r\n  VINCENTIO. Where is that damned villain, Tranio,\r\n    That fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so?\r\n  BAPTISTA. Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?\r\n  BIANCA. Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love\r\n    Made me exchange my state with Tranio,\r\n    While he did bear my countenance in the town;\r\n    And happily I have arrived at the last\r\n    Unto the wished haven of my bliss.\r\n    What Tranio did, myself enforc'd him to;\r\n    Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.\r\n  VINCENTIO. I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me\r\nto\r\n    the gaol.\r\n  BAPTISTA.  [To LUCENTIO]  But do you hear, sir? Have you\r\nmarried my\r\n    daughter without asking my good will?\r\n  VINCENTIO. Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but\r\nI\r\n    will in to be revenged for this villainy.               Exit\r\n  BAPTISTA. And I to sound the depth of this knavery.       Exit\r\n  LUCENTIO. Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.\r\n                                      Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA\r\n  GREMIO. My cake is dough, but I'll in among the rest;\r\n    Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.           Exit\r\n  KATHERINA. Husband, let's follow to see the end of this ado.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. First kiss me, Kate, and we will.\r\n  KATHERINA. What, in the midst of the street?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. What, art thou asham'd of me?\r\n  KATHERINA. No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, then, let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's\r\naway.\r\n  KATHERINA. Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love,\r\nstay.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:\r\n    Better once than never, for never too late.           Exeunt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\nLUCENTIO'S house\r\n\r\nEnter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the PEDANT, LUCENTIO, BIANCA,\r\nPETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, HORTENSIO, and WIDOW. The SERVINGMEN with\r\nTRANIO,\r\nBIONDELLO, and GRUMIO, bringing in a banquet\r\n\r\n  LUCENTIO. At last, though long, our jarring notes agree;\r\n    And time it is when raging war is done\r\n    To smile at scapes and perils overblown.\r\n    My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,\r\n    While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.\r\n    Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,\r\n    And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,\r\n    Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.\r\n    My banquet is to close our stomachs up\r\n    After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;\r\n    For now we sit to chat as well as eat.            [They sit]\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!\r\n  BAPTISTA. Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Padua affords nothing but what is kind.\r\n  HORTENSIO. For both our sakes I would that word were true.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.\r\n  WIDOW. Then never trust me if I be afeard.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. YOU are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:\r\n    I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.\r\n  WIDOW. He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Roundly replied.\r\n  KATHERINA. Mistress, how mean you that?\r\n  WIDOW. Thus I conceive by him.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?\r\n  HORTENSIO. My widow says thus she conceives her tale.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.\r\n  KATHERINA. 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.'\r\n    I pray you tell me what you meant by that.\r\n  WIDOW. Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,\r\n    Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe;\r\n    And now you know my meaning.\r\n  KATHERINA. A very mean meaning.\r\n  WIDOW. Right, I mean you.\r\n  KATHERINA. And I am mean, indeed, respecting you.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. To her, Kate!\r\n  HORTENSIO. To her, widow!\r\n  PETRUCHIO. A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.\r\n  HORTENSIO. That's my office.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Spoke like an officer- ha' to thee, lad.\r\n                                           [Drinks to HORTENSIO]\r\n  BAPTISTA. How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?\r\n  GREMIO. Believe me, sir, they butt together well.\r\n  BIANCA. Head and butt! An hasty-witted body\r\n    Would say your head and butt were head and horn.\r\n  VINCENTIO. Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?\r\n  BIANCA. Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,\r\n    Have at you for a bitter jest or two.\r\n  BIANCA. Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,\r\n    And then pursue me as you draw your bow.\r\n    You are welcome all.\r\n                             Exeunt BIANCA, KATHERINA, and WIDOW\r\n  PETRUCHIO. She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,\r\n    This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;\r\n    Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.\r\n  TRANIO. O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,\r\n    Which runs himself, and catches for his master.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. A good swift simile, but something currish.\r\n  TRANIO. 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself;\r\n    'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.\r\n  BAPTISTA. O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.\r\n  LUCENTIO. I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. 'A has a little gall'd me, I confess;\r\n    And, as the jest did glance away from me,\r\n    'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,\r\n    I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,\r\n    Let's each one send unto his wife,\r\n    And he whose wife is most obedient,\r\n    To come at first when he doth send for her,\r\n    Shall win the wager which we will propose.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Content. What's the wager?\r\n  LUCENTIO. Twenty crowns.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Twenty crowns?\r\n    I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,\r\n    But twenty times so much upon my wife.\r\n  LUCENTIO. A hundred then.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Content.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. A match! 'tis done.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Who shall begin?\r\n  LUCENTIO. That will I.\r\n    Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.\r\n  BIONDELLO. I go.                                          Exit\r\n  BAPTISTA. Son, I'll be your half Bianca comes.\r\n  LUCENTIO. I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.\r\n\r\n                          Re-enter BIONDELLO\r\n\r\n    How now! what news?\r\n  BIONDELLO. Sir, my mistress sends you word\r\n    That she is busy and she cannot come.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. How! She's busy, and she cannot come!\r\n    Is that an answer?\r\n  GREMIO. Ay, and a kind one too.\r\n    Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I hope better.\r\n  HORTENSIO. Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife\r\n    To come to me forthwith.                      Exit BIONDELLO\r\n  PETRUCHIO. O, ho! entreat her!\r\n    Nay, then she must needs come.\r\n  HORTENSIO. I am afraid, sir,\r\n    Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.\r\n\r\n                            Re-enter BIONDELLO\r\n\r\n    Now, where's my wife?\r\n  BIONDELLO. She says you have some goodly jest in hand:\r\n    She will not come; she bids you come to her.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,\r\n    Intolerable, not to be endur'd!\r\n    Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;\r\n    Say I command her come to me.                    Exit GRUMIO\r\n  HORTENSIO. I know her answer.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. What?\r\n  HORTENSIO. She will not.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.\r\n\r\n                             Re-enter KATHERINA\r\n\r\n  BAPTISTA. Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!\r\n  KATHERINA. What is your will, sir, that you send for me?\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?\r\n  KATHERINA. They sit conferring by the parlour fire.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Go, fetch them hither; if they deny to come.\r\n    Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.\r\n    Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.\r\n                                                  Exit KATHERINA\r\n  LUCENTIO. Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.\r\n  HORTENSIO. And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,\r\n    An awful rule, and right supremacy;\r\n    And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy.\r\n  BAPTISTA. Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!\r\n    The wager thou hast won; and I will ad\r\n    Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;\r\n    Another dowry to another daughter,\r\n    For she is chang'd, as she had never been.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Nay, I will win my wager better yet,\r\n    And show more sign of her obedience,\r\n    Her new-built virtue and obedience.\r\n\r\n                 Re-enter KATHERINA with BIANCA and WIDOW\r\n\r\n    See where she comes, and brings your froward wives\r\n    As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.\r\n    Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not:\r\n    Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.\r\n                                            [KATHERINA complies]\r\n  WIDOW. Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh\r\n    Till I be brought to such a silly pass!\r\n  BIANCA. Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?\r\n  LUCENTIO. I would your duty were as foolish too;\r\n    The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,\r\n    Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!\r\n  BIANCA. The more fool you for laying on my duty.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong\r\nwomen\r\n    What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.\r\n  WIDOW. Come, come, you're mocking; we will have no telling.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Come on, I say; and first begin with her.\r\n  WIDOW. She shall not.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. I say she shall. And first begin with her.\r\n  KATHERINA. Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,\r\n    And dart not scornful glances from those eyes\r\n    To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.\r\n    It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,\r\n    Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,\r\n    And in no sense is meet or amiable.\r\n    A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-\r\n    Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;\r\n    And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty\r\n    Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.\r\n    Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,\r\n    Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,\r\n    And for thy maintenance commits his body\r\n    To painful labour both by sea and land,\r\n    To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,\r\n    Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;\r\n    And craves no other tribute at thy hands\r\n    But love, fair looks, and true obedience-\r\n    Too little payment for so great a debt.\r\n    Such duty as the subject owes the prince,\r\n    Even such a woman oweth to her husband;\r\n    And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,\r\n    And not obedient to his honest will,\r\n    What is she but a foul contending rebel\r\n    And graceless traitor to her loving lord?\r\n    I am asham'd that women are so simple\r\n    To offer war where they should kneel for peace;\r\n    Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,\r\n    When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.\r\n    Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,\r\n    Unapt to toll and trouble in the world,\r\n    But that our soft conditions and our hearts\r\n    Should well agree with our external parts?\r\n    Come, come, you froward and unable worins!\r\n    My mind hath been as big as one of yours,\r\n    My heart as great, my reason haply more,\r\n    To bandy word for word and frown for frown;\r\n    But now I see our lances are but straws,\r\n    Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,\r\n    That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.\r\n    Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,\r\n    And place your hands below your husband's foot;\r\n    In token of which duty, if he please,\r\n    My hand is ready, may it do him ease.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.\r\n  LUCENTIO. Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.\r\n  VINCENTIO. 'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.\r\n  LUCENTIO. But a harsh hearing when women are froward.\r\n  PETRUCHIO. Come, Kate, we'll to bed.\r\n    We three are married, but you two are sped.\r\n    [To LUCENTIO]  'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the\r\nwhite;\r\n    And being a winner, God give you good night!\r\n                                  Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA\r\n  HORTENSIO. Now go thy ways; thou hast tam'd a curst shrow.\r\n  LUCENTIO. 'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam'd so.\r\n                                                          Exeunt\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

[_Exit._\r\n\r\n  _Enter _Mariners_._\r\n\r\n_Boats._ Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!              5\r\nyare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the masterâs\r\nwhistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!\r\n\r\n  _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO,\r\n  and others._\r\n\r\n_Alon._ Good boatswain, have care. Whereâs the master?\r\nPlay the men.\r\n\r\n_Boats._ I pray now, keep below.                                    10\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Where is the master, boatswain?\r\n\r\n_Boats._ Do you not hear him? You mar our labour:\r\nkeep your cabins: you do assist the storm.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Nay, good, be patient.\r\n\r\n_Boats._ When the sea is. Hence! What cares these                   15\r\nroarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble\r\nus not.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.\r\n\r\n_Boats._ None that I more love than myself. You are a\r\nCounsellor; if you can command these elements to silence,           20\r\nand work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope\r\nmore; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you\r\nhave lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin\r\nfor the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good\r\nhearts! Out of our way, I say.    [_Exit._                          25\r\n\r\n_Gon._ I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks\r\nhe hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is\r\nperfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:\r\nmake the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth\r\nlittle advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case          30\r\nis miserable.

Before PROSPEROâS cell._\r\n\r\n  _Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA._\r\n\r\n_Mir._ If by your art, my dearest father, you have\r\nPut the wild waters in this roar, allay them.\r\nThe sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,\r\nBut that the sea, mounting to the welkinâs cheek,\r\nDashes the fire out. O, I have sufferâd                              5\r\nWith those that I saw suffer! a brave vessel,\r\nWho had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,\r\nDashâd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock\r\nAgainst my very heart! Poor souls, they perishâd!\r\nHad I been any god of power, I would                                10\r\nHave sunk the sea within the earth, or ere\r\nIt should the good ship so have swallowâd and\r\nThe fraughting souls within her.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                        Be collected:\r\nNo more amazement: tell your piteous heart\r\nThereâs no harm done.\r\n\r\n_Mir._              O, woe the day!\r\n\r\n_Pros._                           No harm.                          15\r\nI have done nothing but in care of thee,\r\nOf thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who\r\nArt ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing\r\nOf whence I am, nor that I am more better\r\nThan Prospero, master of a full poor cell,                          20\r\nAnd thy no greater father.\r\n\r\n_Mir._                   More to know\r\nDid never meddle with my thoughts.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                          âTis time\r\nI should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,\r\nAnd pluck my magic garment from me. --So:\r\n                                [_Lays down his mantle._\r\nLie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.              25\r\nThe direful spectacle of the wreck, which touchâd\r\nThe very virtue of compassion in thee,\r\nI have with such provision in mine art\r\nSo safely orderâd, that there is no soul,\r\nNo, not so much perdition as an hair                                30\r\nBetid to any creature in the vessel\r\nWhich thou heardâst cry, which thou sawâst sink. Sit down;\r\nFor thou must now know farther.\r\n\r\n_Mir._                        You have often\r\nBegun to tell me what I am; but stoppâd,\r\nAnd left me to a bootless inquisition,                              35\r\nConcluding âStay: not yet.â\r\n\r\n_Pros._                The hourâs now come;\r\nThe very minute bids thee ope thine ear;\r\nObey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember\r\nA time before we came unto this cell?\r\nI do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not                   40\r\nOut three years old.\r\n\r\n_Mir._             Certainly, sir, I can.\r\n\r\n_Pros._ By what? by any other house or person?\r\nOf any thing the image tell me that\r\nHath kept with thy remembrance.\r\n\r\n_Mir._                        âTis far off,\r\nAnd rather like a dream than an assurance                           45\r\nThat my remembrance warrants. Had I not\r\nFour or five women once that tended me?\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it\r\nThat this lives in thy mind?

Dear, they durst not,              140\r\nSo dear the love my people bore me; nor set\r\nA mark so bloody on the business; but\r\nWith colours fairer painted their foul ends.\r\nIn few, they hurried us aboard a bark,\r\nBore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared                   145\r\nA rotten carcass of a boat, not riggâd,\r\nNor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats\r\nInstinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,\r\nTo cry to the sea that roarâd to us; to sigh\r\nTo the winds, whose pity, sighing back again,                      150\r\nDid us but loving wrong.\r\n\r\n_Mir._                 Alack, what trouble\r\nWas I then to you!\r\n\r\n_Pros._          O, a cherubin\r\nThou wast that did preserve me.

I have used thee,             345\r\nFilth as thou art, with human care; and lodged thee\r\nIn mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate\r\nThe honour of my child.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ O ho, O ho! would ât had been done!\r\nThou didst prevent me; I had peopled else                          350\r\nThis isle with Calibans.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                Abhorred slave,\r\nWhich any print of goodness wilt not take,\r\nBeing capable of all ill!

But thy vile race,\r\nThough thou didst learn, had that inât which good natures\r\nCould not abide to be with; therefore wast thou                    360\r\nDeservedly confined into this rock,\r\nWho hadst deserved more than a prison.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ You taught me language; and my profit onât\r\nIs, I know how to curse.

Our hint of woe\r\nIs common; every day, some sailorâs wife,\r\nThe masters of some merchant, and the merchant,                      5\r\nHave just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,\r\nI mean our preservation, few in millions\r\nCan speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh\r\nOur sorrow with our comfort.\r\n\r\n_Alon._                    Prithee, peace.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ He receives comfort like cold porridge.                      10\r\n\r\n_Ant._ The visitor will not give him oâer so.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Look, heâs winding up the watch of his wit; by\r\nand by it will strike.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Sir,--\r\n\r\n_Seb._ One: tell.                                                   15\r\n\r\n_Gon._ When every grief is entertainâd thatâs offerâd,\r\nComes to the entertainer--\r\n\r\n_Seb._ A dollar.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Dolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken\r\ntruer than you purposed.                                            20\r\n\r\n_Seb._ You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Therefore, my lord,--\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!\r\n\r\n_Alon._ I prithee, spare.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Well, I have done: but yet,--                                25\r\n\r\n_Seb._ He will be talking.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first\r\nbegins to crow?\r\n\r\n_Seb._ The old cock.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ The cockerel.                                                30\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Done. The wager?\r\n\r\n_Ant._ A laughter.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ A match!\r\n\r\n_Adr._ Though this island seem to be desert,--\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Ha, ha, ha!--So, youâre paid.                                35\r\n\r\n_Adr._ Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible,--\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Yet,--\r\n\r\n_Adr._ Yet,--\r\n\r\n_Ant._ He could not missât.\r\n\r\n_Adr._ It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate              40\r\ntemperance.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Temperance was a delicate wench.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.\r\n\r\n_Adr._ The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.                         45\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Or as âtwere perfumed by a fen.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Here is every thing advantageous to life.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ True; save means to live.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Of that thereâs none, or little.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!               50\r\n\r\n_Ant._ The ground, indeed, is tawny.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ With an eye of green inât.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ He misses not much.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost             55\r\nbeyond credit,--\r\n\r\n_Seb._ As many vouched rarities are.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ That our garments, being, as they were, drenched\r\nin the sea, hold, notwithstanding, their freshness and glosses,\r\nbeing rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.                 60\r\n\r\n_Ant._ If but one of his pockets could speak, would it\r\nnot say he lies?\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when\r\nwe put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the kingâs        65\r\nfair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ âTwas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in\r\nour return.\r\n\r\n_Adr._ Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon\r\nto their queen.                                                     70\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Not since widow Didoâs time.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Widow! a pox oâ that! How came that widow\r\nin? widow Dido!\r\n\r\n_Seb._ What if he had said âwidower Ãneasâ too? Good\r\nLord, how you take it!                                              75\r\n\r\n_Adr._ âWidow Didoâ said you? you make me study of\r\nthat: she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.\r\n\r\n_Adr._ Carthage?\r\n\r\n_Gon._ I assure you, Carthage.                                      80\r\n\r\n_Seb._ His word is more than the miraculous harp; he\r\nhath raised the wall, and houses too.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ What impossible matter will he make easy next?\r\n\r\n_Seb._ I think he will carry this island home in his\r\npocket, and give it his son for an apple.                           85\r\n\r\n_Ant._ And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring\r\nforth more islands.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Ay.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Why, in good time.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now              90\r\nas fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your\r\ndaughter, who is now queen.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ And the rarest that eâer came there.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.                               95\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I\r\nwore it? I mean, in a sort.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ That sort was well fished for.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ When I wore it at your daughterâs marriage?\r\n\r\n_Alon._ You cram these words into mine ears against                100\r\nThe stomach of my sense. Would I had never\r\nMarried my daughter there! for, coming thence,\r\nMy son is lost, and, in my rate, she too.\r\nWho is so far from Italy removed\r\nI neâer again shall see her. O thou mine heir                      105\r\nOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fish\r\nHath made his meal on thee?\r\n\r\n_Fran._                   Sir, he may live:\r\nI saw him beat the surges under him,\r\nAnd ride upon their backs; he trod the water.\r\nWhose enmity he flung aside, and breasted                          110\r\nThe surge most swoln that met him; his bold head\r\nâBove the contentious waves he kept, and oarâd\r\nHimself with his good arms in lusty stroke\r\nTo the shore, that oâer his wave-worn basis bowâd,\r\nAs stooping to relieve him: I not doubt                            115\r\nHe came alive to land.\r\n\r\n_Alon._              No, no, heâs gone.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,\r\nThat would not bless our Europe with your daughter,\r\nBut rather lose her to an African;\r\nWhere she, at least, is banishâd from your eye,                    120\r\nWho hath cause to wet the grief onât.\r\n\r\n_Alon._                             Prithee, peace.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ You were kneelâd to, and importuned otherwise,\r\nBy all of us; and the fair soul herself\r\nWeighâd between loathness and obedience, at\r\nWhich end oâ the beam should bow. We have lost your son,           125\r\nI fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have\r\nMore widows in them of this businessâ making\r\nThan we bring men to comfort them:\r\nThe faultâs your own.\r\n\r\n_Alon._             So is the dearâst oâ the loss.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ My lord Sebastian,                                          130\r\nThe truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,\r\nAnd time to speak it in: you rub the sore,\r\nWhen you should bring the plaster.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                           Very well.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ And most chirurgeonly.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ It is foul weather in us all, good sir,                     135\r\nWhen you are cloudy.\r\n\r\n_Seb._             Foul weather?\r\n\r\n_Ant._                         Very foul.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Heâld sowât with nettle-seed.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                             Or docks, or mallows.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ And were the king onât, what would I do?\r\n\r\n_Seb._ âScape being drunk for want of wine.                        140\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Iâ the commonwealth I would by contraries\r\nExecute all things; for no kind of traffic\r\nWould I admit; no name of magistrate;\r\nLetters should not be known; riches, poverty,\r\nAnd use of service, none; contract, succession,                    145\r\nBourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\r\nNo use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\r\nNo occupation; all men idle, all;\r\nAnd women too, but innocent and pure;\r\nNo sovereignty;--                                                  150\r\n\r\n_Seb._      Yet he would be king onât.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ All things in common nature should produce\r\nWithout sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,\r\nSword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,                    155\r\nWould I not have; but nature should bring forth,\r\nOf its own kind, all foison, all abundance,\r\nTo feed my innocent people.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ No marrying âmong his subjects?\r\n\r\n_Ant._ None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.                     160\r\n\r\n_Gon._ I would with such perfection govern, sir,\r\nTo excel the golden age.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                 âSave his majesty!\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Long live Gonzalo!\r\n\r\n_Gon._                  And,--do you mark me, sir?\r\n\r\n_Alon._ Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister     165\r\noccasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible\r\nand nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ âTwas you we laughed at.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to\r\nyou: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.              170\r\n\r\n_Ant._ What a blow was there given!\r\n\r\n_Seb._ An it had not fallen flat-long.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would\r\nlift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it\r\nfive weeks without changing.                                       175\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Enter ARIEL (invisible) playing solemn music._\r\n\r\n_Seb._ We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Nay, good my lord, be not angry.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion\r\nso weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very\r\nheavy?                                                             180\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Go sleep, and hear us.\r\n            [_All sleep except Alon., Seb., and Ant._\r\n\r\n_Alon._ What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes\r\nWould, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find\r\nThey are inclined to do so.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                    Please you, sir,\r\nDo not omit the heavy offer of it:                                 185\r\nIt seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,\r\nIt is a comforter.\r\n\r\n_Ant._           We two, my lord,\r\nWill guard your person while you take your rest,\r\nAnd watch your safety.\r\n\r\n_Alon._              Thank you.--Wondrous heavy.\r\n                                [_Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel._\r\n\r\n_Seb._ What a strange drowsiness possesses them!                   190\r\n\r\n_Ant._ It is the quality oâ the climate.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                                 Why\r\nDoth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not\r\nMyself disposed to sleep.\r\n\r\n_Ant._                  Nor I; my spirits are nimble.\r\nThey fell together all, as by consent;\r\nThey droppâd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,                  195\r\nWorthy Sebastian?--O, what might?--No more:--\r\nAnd yet methinks I see it in thy face,\r\nWhat thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee; and\r\nMy strong imagination sees a crown\r\nDropping upon thy head.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                What, art thou waking?                       200\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Do you not hear me speak?\r\n\r\n_Seb._                         I do; and surely\r\nIt is a sleepy language, and thou speakâst\r\nOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?\r\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleep\r\nWith eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,                   205\r\nAnd yet so fast asleep.\r\n\r\n_Ant._                Noble Sebastian,\r\nThou letâst thy fortune sleep--die, rather; winkâst\r\nWhiles thou art waking.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                Thou dost snore distinctly;\r\nThereâs meaning in thy snores.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ I am more serious than my custom: you                       210\r\nMust be so too, if heed me; which to do\r\nTrebles thee oâer.\r\n\r\n_Seb._           Well, I am standing water.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Iâll teach you how to flow.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                           Do so: to ebb\r\nHereditary sloth instructs me.\r\n\r\n_Ant._                       O,\r\nIf you but knew how you the purpose cherish                        215\r\nWhiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,\r\nYou more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,\r\nMost often do so near the bottom run\r\nBy their own fear or sloth.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                    Prithee, say on:\r\nThe setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim                        220\r\nA matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,\r\nWhich throes thee much to yield.\r\n\r\n_Ant._                         Thus, sir:\r\nAlthough this lord of weak remembrance, this,\r\nWho shall be of as little memory\r\nWhen he is earthâd, hath here almost persuaded,--                  225\r\nFor heâs a spirit of persuasion, only\r\nProfesses to persuade,--the king his sonâs alive,\r\nâTis as impossible that heâs undrownâd\r\nAs he that sleeps here swims.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                      I have no hope\r\nThat heâs undrownâd.\r\n\r\n_Ant._             O, out of that âno hopeâ                        230\r\nWhat great hope have you! no hope that way is\r\nAnother way so high a hope that even\r\nAmbition cannot pierce a wink beyond,\r\nBut doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me\r\nThat Ferdinand is drownâd?\r\n\r\n_Seb._                   Heâs gone.\r\n\r\n_Ant._                            Then, tell me,                   235\r\nWhoâs the next heir of Naples?\r\n\r\n_Seb._                       Claribel.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells\r\nTen leagues beyond manâs life; she that from Naples\r\nCan have no note, unless the sun were post,--\r\nThe man iâ the moonâs too slow,--till new-born chins               240\r\nBe rough and razorable; she that from whom\r\nWe all were sea-swallowâd, though some cast again,\r\nAnd by that destiny, to perform an act\r\nWhereof whatâs past is prologue; what to come,\r\nIn yours and my discharge.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                   What stuff is this! How say you?          245\r\nâTis true, my brotherâs daughterâs queen of Tunis;\r\nSo is she heir of Naples; âtwixt which regions\r\nThere is some space.\r\n\r\n_Ant._             A space whose every cubit\r\nSeems to cry out, âHow shall that Claribel\r\nMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,                          250\r\nAnd let Sebastian wake.â Say, this were death\r\nThat now hath seized them; why, they were no worse\r\nThan now they are. There be that can rule Naples\r\nAs well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate\r\nAs amply and unnecessarily                                         255\r\nAs this Gonzalo; I myself could make\r\nA chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore\r\nThe mind that I do! what a sleep were this\r\nFor your advancement! Do you understand me?\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Methinks I do.\r\n\r\n_Ant._              And how does your content                      260\r\nTender your own good fortune?\r\n\r\n_Seb._                      I remember\r\nYou did supplant your brother Prospero.\r\n\r\n_Ant._                                True:\r\nAnd look how well my garments sit upon me;\r\nMuch feater than before: my brotherâs servants\r\nWere then my fellows; now they are my men.                         265\r\n\r\n_Seb._ But for your conscience.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Ay, sir; where lies that? if âtwere a kibe,\r\nâTwould put me to my slipper: but I feel not\r\nThis deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,\r\nThat stand âtwixt me and Milan, candied be they,                   270\r\nAnd melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother,\r\nNo better than the earth he lies upon,\r\nIf he were that which now heâs like, thatâs dead;\r\nWhom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,\r\nCan lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,                   275\r\nTo the perpetual wink for aye might put\r\nThis ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who\r\nShould not upbraid our course. For all the rest,\r\nTheyâll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;\r\nTheyâll tell the clock to any business that                        280\r\nWe say befits the hour.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                Thy case, dear friend,\r\nShall be my precedent; as thou gotâst Milan,\r\nIâll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke\r\nShall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;\r\nAnd I the king shall love thee.\r\n\r\n_Ant._                        Draw together;                       285\r\nAnd when I rear my hand, do you the like,\r\nTo fall it on Gonzalo.\r\n\r\n_Seb._               O, but one word.      [_They talk apart._\r\n\r\n  _Re-enter ARIEL invisible._\r\n\r\n_Ari._ My master through his art foresees the danger\r\nThat you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth,--\r\nFor else his project dies,--to keep them living.                   290\r\n                            [_Sings in Gonzaloâs ear._\r\n\r\nWhile you here do snoring lie,\r\nOpen-eyed conspiracy\r\n    His time doth take.\r\nIf of life you keep a care,\r\nShake off slumber, and beware:                                     295\r\n    Awake, awake!\r\n\r\n_Ant._ Then let us both be sudden.\r\n\r\n_Gon._                           Now, good angels\r\nPreserve the king!

A noise of thunder heard._\r\n\r\n_Cal._ All the infections that the sun sucks up\r\nFrom bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him\r\nBy inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me,\r\nAnd yet I needs must curse. But theyâll nor pinch,\r\nFright me with urchin-shows, pitch me iâ the mire,                   5\r\nNor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark\r\nOut of my way, unless he bid âem: but\r\nFor every trifle are they set upon me;\r\nSometime like apes, that mow and chatter at me,\r\nAnd after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which                       10\r\nLie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount\r\nTheir pricks at my footfall; sometime am I\r\nAll wound with adders, who with cloven tongues\r\nDo hiss me into madness.\r\n\r\n  _Enter TRINCULO._\r\n\r\n                        Lo, now, lo!\r\nHere comes a spirit of his, and to torment me                       15\r\nFor bringing wood in slowly. Iâll fall flat;\r\nPerchance he will not mind me.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Hereâs neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any\r\nweather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing iâ\r\nthe wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks               20\r\nlike a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should\r\nthunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head:\r\nyond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What\r\nhave we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he\r\nsmells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind      25\r\nof not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I\r\nin England now, as once I was, and had but this fish\r\npainted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of\r\nsilver: there would this monster make a man; any strange\r\nbeast there makes a man: when they will not give a doit to          30\r\nrelieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead\r\nIndian. Legged like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm\r\noâ my troth! I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no\r\nlonger: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately\r\nsuffered by a thunderbolt. [_Thunder._] Alas, the storm is come     35\r\nagain! my best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there\r\nis no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with\r\nstrange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the\r\nstorm be past.\r\n\r\n  _Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand._\r\n\r\n_Ste._ I shall no more to sea, to sea,                              40\r\n                Here shall I die a-shore,--\r\n\r\nThis is a very scurvy tune to sing at a manâs funeral: well,\r\nhereâs my comfort.                                  [_Drinks._\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Sings._ The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,\r\n                       The gunner, and his mate,                    45\r\n               Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,\r\n                   But none of us cared for Kate;\r\n                   For she had a tongue with a tang,\r\n                   Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!\r\n               She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch;        50\r\n               Yet a tailor might scratch her whereâer she did itch.\r\n                   Then, to sea, boys, and let her go hang!\r\n\r\nThis is a scurvy tune too: but hereâs my comfort. [_Drinks._\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Do not torment me:--O!\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Whatâs the matter? Have we devils here? Do                   55\r\nyou put tricks upon âs with savages and men of Ind, ha? I\r\nhave not scaped drowning, to be afeard now of your four\r\nlegs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever went\r\non four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be\r\nsaid so again, while Stephano breathes atâs nostrils.               60\r\n\r\n_Cal._ The spirit torments me:--O!\r\n\r\n_Ste._ This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who\r\nhath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he\r\nlearn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be\r\nbut for that. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, and          65\r\nget to Naples with him, heâs a present for any emperor that\r\never trod on neatâs-leather.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Do not torment me, prithee; Iâll bring my wood\r\nhome faster.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Heâs in his fit now, and does not talk after the             70\r\nwisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk\r\nwine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover\r\nhim, and keep him tame, I will not take too much for\r\nhim; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I          75\r\nknow it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that\r\nwhich will give language to you, cat: open your mouth; this\r\nwill shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly:\r\nyou cannot tell whoâs your friend: open your chaps again.           80\r\n\r\n_Trin._ I should know that voice: it should be--but he\r\nis drowned; and these are devils:--O defend me!\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Four legs and two voices,--a most delicate monster!\r\nHis forward voice, now, is to speak well of his friend;\r\nhis backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.        85\r\nIf all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help\r\nhis ague. Come:--Amen! I will pour some in thy other\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Stephano!\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!                  90\r\nThis is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have\r\nno long spoon.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me,\r\nand speak to me; for I am Trinculo,--be not afeard,--thy\r\ngood friend Trinculo.                                               95\r\n\r\n_Ste._ If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: Iâll pull thee\r\nby the lesser legs: if any be Trinculoâs legs, these are they.\r\nThou art very Trinculo indeed! How earnest thou to be\r\nthe siege of this moon-calf? can he vent Trinculos?\r\n\r\n_Trin._ I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.             100\r\nBut art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope, now, thou\r\nart not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me\r\nunder the dead moon-calfâs gaberdine for fear of the storm.\r\nAnd art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans\r\nscaped!                                                            105\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ [_aside_] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.\r\nThatâs a brave god, and bears celestial liquor:\r\nI will kneel to him.                                               110\r\n\r\n_Ste._ How didst thou âscape? How camest thou hither?\r\nswear, by this bottle, how thou camest hither. I escaped\r\nupon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved oâerboard, by\r\nthis bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree with mine\r\nown hands, since I was cast ashore.                                115\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Iâll swear, upon that bottle, to be thy true subject;\r\nfor the liquor is not earthly.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Here; swear, then, how thou escapedst.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Swum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim\r\nlike a duck, Iâll be sworn.                                        120\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim\r\nlike a duck, thou art made like a goose.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ O Stephano, hast any more of this?\r\n\r\n_Ste._ The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by\r\nthe sea-side, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!            125\r\nhow does thine ague?\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Hast thou not droppâd from heaven?\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Out oâ the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man\r\niâ the moon when time was.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee:               130\r\nMy mistress showâd me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish\r\nit anon with new contents: swear.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!\r\nI afeard of him! A very weak monster! The                          135\r\nman iâ the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well\r\ndrawn, monster, in good sooth!\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Iâll show thee every fertile inch oâ thâ island;\r\nAnd I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ By this light, a most perfidious and drunken               140\r\nmonster! whenâs godâs asleep, heâll rob his bottle.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Iâll kiss thy foot; Iâll swear myself thy subject.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Come on, then; down, and swear.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed\r\nmonster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in                    145\r\nmy heart to beat him,--\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Come, kiss.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ But that the poor monsterâs in drink: an abominable\r\nmonster!\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Iâll show thee the best springs; Iâll pluck thee berries;   150\r\nIâll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.\r\nA plague upon the tyrant that I serve!\r\nIâll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,\r\nThou wondrous man.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder                155\r\nof a poor drunkard!\r\n\r\n_Cal._ I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;\r\nAnd I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;\r\nShow thee a jayâs nest, and instruct thee how\r\nTo snare the nimble marmoset; Iâll bring thee                      160\r\nTo clustering filberts, and sometimes Iâll get thee\r\nYoung scamels from the rock.

This my mean task\r\nWould be as heavy to me as odious, but                               5\r\nThe mistress which I serve quickens whatâs dead,\r\nAnd makes my labours pleasures: O, she is\r\nTen times more gentle than her fatherâs crabbed.\r\nAnd heâs composed of harshness. I must remove\r\nSome thousands of these logs, and pile them up,                     10\r\nUpon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress\r\nWeeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness\r\nHad never like executor. I forget:\r\nBut these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,\r\nMost busy lest, when I do it.\r\n\r\n  _Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen._\r\n\r\n_Mir._                  Alas, now, pray you,                        15\r\nWork not so hard: I would the lightning had\r\nBurnt up those logs that you are enjoinâd to pile!\r\nPray, set it down, and rest you: when this burns,\r\nâTwill weep for having wearied you. My father\r\nIs hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself;                         20\r\nHeâs safe for these three hours.\r\n\r\n_Fer._                         O most dear mistress,\r\nThe sun will set before I shall discharge\r\nWhat I must strive to do.\r\n\r\n_Mir._                  If youâll sit down,\r\nIâll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;\r\nIâll carry it to the pile.\r\n\r\n_Fer._                   No, precious creature;                     25\r\nI had rather crack my sinews, break my back,\r\nThan you should such dishonour undergo,\r\nWhile I sit lazy by.\r\n\r\n_Mir._             It would become me\r\nAs well as it does you: and I should do it\r\nWith much more ease; for my good will is to it,                     30\r\nAnd yours it is against.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                Poor worm, thou art infected!\r\nThis visitation shows it.\r\n\r\n_Mir._                  You look wearily.\r\n\r\n_Fer._ No, noble mistress; âtis fresh morning with me\r\nWhen you are by at night. I do beseech you,--\r\nChiefly that I might set it in my prayers,--                        35\r\nWhat is your name?\r\n\r\n_Mir._           Miranda. --O my father,\r\nI have broke your hest to say so!\r\n\r\n_Fer._                          Admired Miranda!\r\nIndeed the top of admiration! worth\r\nWhatâs dearest to the world! Full many a lady\r\nI have eyed with best regard, and many a time                       40\r\nThe harmony of their tongues hath into bondage\r\nBrought my too diligent ear: for several virtues\r\nHave I liked several women; never any\r\nWith so full soul, but some defect in her\r\nDid quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,                        45\r\nAnd put it to the foil: but you, O you,\r\nSo perfect and so peerless, are created\r\nOf every creatureâs best!\r\n\r\n_Mir._             I do not know\r\nOne of my sex; no womanâs face remember,\r\nSave, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen                      50\r\nMore that I may call men than you, good friend,\r\nAnd my dear father: how features are abroad,\r\nI am skilless of; but, by my modesty,\r\nThe jewel in my dower, I would not wish\r\nAny companion in the world but you;                                 55\r\nNor can imagination form a shape,\r\nBesides yourself, to like of. But I prattle\r\nSomething too wildly, and my fatherâs precepts\r\nI therein do forget.\r\n\r\n_Fer._             I am, in my condition,\r\nA prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;                              60\r\nI would, not so!--and would no more endure\r\nThis wooden slavery than to suffer\r\nThe flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:\r\nThe very instant that I saw you, did\r\nMy heart fly to your service; there resides,                        65\r\nTo make me slave to it; and for your sake\r\nAm I this patient log-man.\r\n\r\n_Mir._                   Do you love me?\r\n\r\n_Fer._ O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,\r\nAnd crown what I profess with kind event,\r\nIf I speak true! if hollowly, invert                                70\r\nWhat best is boded me to mischief! I,\r\nBeyond all limit of what else iâ the world,\r\nDo love, prize, honour you.\r\n\r\n_Mir._                    I am a fool\r\nTo weep at what I am glad of.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                     Fair encounter\r\nOf two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace                     75\r\nOn that which breeds between âem!\r\n\r\n_Fer._                          Wherefore weep you?\r\n\r\n_Mir._ At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer\r\nWhat I desire to give; and much less take\r\nWhat I shall die to want. But this is trifling;\r\nAnd all the more it seeks to hide itself,                           80\r\nThe bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!\r\nAnd prompt me, plain and holy innocence!\r\nI am your wife, if you will marry me;\r\nIf not, Iâll die your maid: to be your fellow\r\nYou may deny me; but Iâll be your servant,                          85\r\nWhether you will or no.\r\n\r\n_Fer._                My mistress, dearest;\r\nAnd I thus humble ever.\r\n\r\n_Mir._                My husband, then?\r\n\r\n_Fer._ Ay, with a heart as willing\r\nAs bondage eâer of freedom: hereâs my hand.\r\n\r\n_Mir._ And mine, with my heart inât: and now farewell               90\r\nTill half an hour hence.\r\n\r\n_Fer._                 A thousand thousand!\r\n\r\n    [_Exeunt Fer. and Mir. severally._\r\n\r\n_Pros._ So glad of this as they I cannot be,\r\nWho are surprised withal; but my rejoicing\r\nAt nothing can be more. Iâll to my book;\r\nFor yet, ere supper-time, must I perform                            95\r\nMuch business appertaining.

They\r\nsay thereâs but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if        5\r\nthâ other two be brained like us, the state totters.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes\r\nare almost set in thy head.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Where should they be set else? he were a brave\r\nmonster indeed, if they were set in his tail.                       10\r\n\r\n_Ste._ My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack:\r\nfor my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could\r\nrecover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on. By\r\nthis light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my\r\nstandard.                                                           15\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Your lieutenant, if you list; heâs no standard.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Weâll not run, Monsieur Monster.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Nor go neither; but youâll lie, like dogs, and\r\nyet say nothing neither.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a           20\r\ngood moon-calf.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.\r\nIâll not serve him, he is not valiant.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case\r\nto justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was          25\r\nthere ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as\r\nI to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a\r\nfish and half a monster?\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?\r\n\r\n_Trin._ âLord,â quoth he! That a monster should be                  30\r\nsuch a natural!\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you\r\nprove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monsterâs my\r\nsubject, and he shall not suffer indignity.                         35\r\n\r\n_Cal._ I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to\r\nhearken once again to the suit I made to thee?\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Marry, will I: kneel and repeat it; I will stand,\r\nand so shall Trinculo.\r\n\r\n  _Enter ARIEL, invisible._\r\n\r\n_Cal._ As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a           40\r\nsorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.\r\n\r\n_Ari._ Thou liest.\r\n\r\n_Cal._           Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou:\r\nI would my valiant master would destroy thee!\r\nI do not lie.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Trinculo, if you trouble him any more inâs tale, by          45\r\nthis hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Why, I said nothing.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ I say, by sorcery he got this isle;\r\nFrom me he got it. If thy greatness will                            50\r\nRevenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,\r\nBut this thing dare not,--\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Thatâs most certain.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Thou shalt be lord of it, and Iâll serve thee.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou                  55\r\nbring me to the party?\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Yea, yea, my lord: Iâll yield him thee asleep,\r\nWhere thou mayst knock a nail into his head.\r\n\r\n_Ari._ Thou liest; thou canst not.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ What a pied ninnyâs this! Thou scurvy patch!                 60\r\nI do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows,\r\nAnd take his bottle from him: when thatâs gone,\r\nHe shall drink nought but brine; for Iâll not show him\r\nWhere the quick freshes are.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the          65\r\nmonster one word further, and, by this hand, Iâll turn my\r\nmercy out oâ doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Why, what did I? I did nothing. Iâll go farther\r\noff.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Didst thou not say he lied?                                  70\r\n\r\n_Ari._ Thou liest.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Do I so? take thou that. [_Beats him._] As you\r\nlike this, give me the lie another time.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ I did not give the lie. Out oâ your wits, and\r\nhearing too? A pox oâ your bottle! this can sack and                75\r\ndrinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil\r\ntake your fingers!\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Ha, ha, ha!\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Now, forward with your tale. --Prithee, stand farther\r\noff.                                                                80\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Beat him enough: after a little time,\r\nIâll beat him too.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Stand farther. Come, proceed.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Why, as I told thee, âtis a custom with him\r\nIâ thâ afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,\r\nHaving first seized his books; or with a log                        85\r\nBatter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,\r\nOr cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember\r\nFirst to possess his books; for without them\r\nHeâs but a sot, as I am, nor hath not\r\nOne spirit to command: they all do hate him                         90\r\nAs rootedly as I. Burn but his books.\r\nHe has brave utensils,--for so he calls them,--\r\nWhich, when he has a house, heâll deck withal.\r\nAnd that most deeply to consider is\r\nThe beauty of his daughter; he himself                              95\r\nCalls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,\r\nBut only Sycorax my dam and she;\r\nBut she as far surpasseth Sycorax\r\nAs greatâst does least.\r\n\r\n_Ste._                Is it so brave a lass?\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,               100\r\nAnd bring thee forth brave brood.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I\r\nwill be king and queen,--save our Graces!--and Trinculo\r\nand thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot,\r\nTrinculo?                                                          105\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Excellent.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,\r\nwhile thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Within this half hour will he be asleep:\r\nWilt thou destroy him then?\r\n\r\n_Ste._                    Ay, on mine honour.                      110\r\n\r\n_Ari._ This will I tell my master.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:\r\nLet us be jocund: will you troll the catch\r\nYou taught me but while-ere?\r\n\r\n_Ste._ At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any              115\r\nreason. --Come on. Trinculo, let us sing.      [_Sings._\r\n\r\n  Flout âem and scout âem, and scout âem and flout âem;\r\n  Thought is free.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Thatâs not the tune.\r\n\r\n  [_Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe._\r\n\r\n_Ste._ What is this same?                                          120\r\n\r\n_Trin._ This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture\r\nof Nobody.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:\r\nif thou beest a devil, takeât as thou list.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ O, forgive me my sins!                                     125\r\n\r\n_Ste._ He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy\r\nupon us!\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Art thou afeard?\r\n\r\n_Ste._ No, monster, not I.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,                  130\r\nSounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.\r\nSometimes a thousand twangling instruments\r\nWill hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,\r\nThat, if I then had waked after long sleep,\r\nWill make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,                   135\r\nThe clouds methought would open, and show riches\r\nReady to drop upon me; that, when I waked,\r\nI cried to dream again.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I\r\nshall have my music for nothing.                                   140\r\n\r\n_Cal._ When Prospero is destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ That shall be by and by: I remember the story.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ The sound is going away; letâs follow it, and\r\nafter do our work.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Lead, monster; weâll follow. I would I could see            145\r\nthis taborer; he lays it on.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Wilt come? Iâll follow, Stephano.    [_Exeunt._\r\n\r\n\r\n  Notes: III, 2.\r\n\r\n  SCENE II.

By your patience,\r\nI needs must rest me.\r\n\r\n_Alon._             Old lord, I cannot blame thee,\r\nWho am myself attachâd with weariness,                               5\r\nTo the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.\r\nEven here I will put off my hope, and keep it\r\nNo longer for my flatterer: he is drownâd\r\nWhom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks\r\nOur frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.                     10\r\n\r\n_Ant._ [_Aside to Seb._] I am right glad that heâs so out of hope.\r\nDo not, for one repulse, forego the purpose\r\nThat you resolved to effect.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ [_Aside to Ant._] The next advantage\r\nWill we take throughly.\r\n\r\n_Ant._ [_Aside to Seb._] Let it be to-night;\r\nFor, now they are oppressâd with travel, they                       15\r\nWill not, nor cannot, use such vigilance\r\nAs when they are fresh.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ [_Aside to Ant._] I say, to-night: no more.\r\n\r\n  [_Solemn and strange music._\r\n\r\n_Alon._ What harmony is this?--My good friends, hark!\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Marvellous sweet music!\r\n\r\n  _Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes,\r\n  bringing in a banquet: they dance about it with gentle actions of\r\n  salutation; and, inviting the King, &c. to eat, they depart._\r\n\r\n_Alon._ Give us kind keepers, heavens!--What were these?            20\r\n\r\n_Seb._ A living drollery. Now I will believe\r\nThat there are unicorns; that in Arabia\r\nThere is one tree, the phÅnixâ throne; one phÅnix\r\nAt this hour reigning there.\r\n\r\n_Ant._                     Iâll believe both;\r\nAnd what does else want credit, come to me,                         25\r\nAnd Iâll be sworn âtis true: travellers neâer did lie,\r\nThough fools at home condemn âem.\r\n\r\n_Gon._                          If in Naples\r\nI should report this now, would they believe me?\r\nIf I should say, I saw such islanders,--\r\nFor, certes, these are people of the island,--                      30\r\nWho, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,\r\nTheir manners are more gentle-kind than of\r\nOur human generation you shall find\r\nMany, nay, almost any.\r\n\r\n_Pros._              [_Aside_] Honest lord,\r\nThou hast said well; for some of you there present                  35\r\nAre worse than devils.\r\n\r\n_Alon._              I cannot too much muse\r\nSuch shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing--\r\nAlthough they want the use of tongue--a kind\r\nOf excellent dumb discourse.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                    [_Aside_] Praise in departing.\r\n\r\n_Fran._ They vanishâd strangely.\r\n\r\n_Seb._                         No matter, since                     40\r\nThey have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.--\r\nWillât please you taste of what is here?\r\n\r\n_Alon._                                Not I.\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,\r\nWho would believe that there were mountaineers\r\nDew-lappâd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at âem             45\r\nWallets of flesh? or that there were such men\r\nWhose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find\r\nEach putter-out of five for one will bring us\r\nGood warrant of.\r\n\r\n_Alon._        I will stand to, and feed,\r\nAlthough my last: no matter, since I feel                           50\r\nThe best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,\r\nStand to, and do as we.\r\n\r\n  _Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a harpy; claps his\r\n  wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet\r\n  vanishes._\r\n\r\n_Ari._ You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,--\r\nThat hath to instrument this lower world\r\nAnd what is inât,--the never-surfeited sea                          55\r\nHath caused to belch up you; and on this island,\r\nWhere man doth not inhabit,--you âmongst men\r\nBeing most unfit to live. I have made you mad;\r\nAnd even with such-like valour men hang and drown\r\nTheir proper selves.    [_Alon., Seb. &c. draw their swords._\r\n                   You fools! I and my fellows                      60\r\nAre ministers of Fate: the elements,\r\nOf whom your swords are temperâd, may as well\r\nWound the loud winds, or with bemockâd-at stabs\r\nKill the still-closing waters, as diminish\r\nOne dowle thatâs in my plume: my fellow-ministers                   65\r\nAre like invulnerable. If you could hurt,\r\nYour swords are now too massy for your strengths,\r\nAnd will not be uplifted. But remember,--\r\nFor thatâs my business to you,--that you three\r\nFrom Milan did supplant good Prospero;                              70\r\nExposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,\r\nHim and his innocent child: for which foul deed\r\nThe powers, delaying, not forgetting, have\r\nIncensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,\r\nAgainst your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,                        75\r\nThey have bereft; and do pronounce by me:\r\nLingering perdition--worse than any death\r\nCan be at once--shall step by step attend\r\nYou and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from,--\r\nWhich here, in this most desolate isle, else falls                  80\r\nUpon your heads,--is nothing but heart-sorrow\r\nAnd a clear life ensuing.\r\n\r\n  _He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music, enter the Shapes\r\n  again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the\r\n  table._\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou\r\nPerformâd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:\r\nOf my instruction hast thou nothing bated                           85\r\nIn what thou hadst to say: so, with good life\r\nAnd observation strange, my meaner ministers\r\nTheir several kinds have done. My high charms work,\r\nAnd these mine enemies are all knit up\r\nIn their distractions: they now are in my power;                    90\r\nAnd in these fits I leave them, while I visit\r\nYoung Ferdinand,--whom they suppose is drownâd,--\r\nAnd his and mine loved darling.    [_Exit above._\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Iâ the name of something holy, sir, why stand you\r\nIn this strange stare?\r\n\r\n_Alon._              O, it is monstrous, monstrous!                 95\r\nMethought the billows spoke, and told me of it;\r\nThe winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,\r\nThat deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced\r\nThe name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.\r\nTherefore my son iâ thâ ooze is bedded; and                        100\r\nIâll seek him deeper than eâer plummet sounded,\r\nAnd with him there lie mudded.    [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Seb._                       But one fiend at a time,\r\nIâll fight their legions oâer.\r\n\r\n_Ant._                       Iâll be thy second.\r\n\r\n    [_Exeunt Seb. and Ant._\r\n\r\n_Gon._ All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,\r\nLike poison given to work a great time after,                      105\r\nNow âgins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you,\r\nThat are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly,\r\nAnd hinder them from what this ecstasy\r\nMay now provoke them to.\r\n\r\n_Adr._                 Follow, I pray you.

O Ferdinand,\r\nDo not smile at me that I boast her off,\r\nFor thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise,                   10\r\nAnd make it halt behind her.\r\n\r\n_Fer._                     I do believe it\r\nAgainst an oracle.\r\n\r\n_Pros._          Then, as my gift, and thine own acquisition\r\nWorthily purchased, take my daughter: but\r\nIf thou dost break her virgin-knot before                           15\r\nAll sanctimonious ceremonies may\r\nWith full and holy rite be ministerâd,\r\nNo sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall\r\nTo make this contract grow; but barren hate,\r\nSour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew                         20\r\nThe union of your bed with weeds so loathly\r\nThat you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,\r\nAs Hymenâs lamps shall light you.\r\n\r\n_Fer._                          As I hope\r\nFor quiet days, fair issue and long life,\r\nWith such love as âtis now, the murkiest den,                       25\r\nThe most opportune place, the strongâst suggestion\r\nOur worser Genius can, shall never melt\r\nMine honour into lust, to take away\r\nThe edge of that dayâs celebration\r\nWhen I shall think, or PhÅbusâ steeds are founderâd,                30\r\nOr Night kept chainâd below.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                    Fairly spoke.\r\nSit, then, and talk with her; she is thine own.\r\nWhat, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!\r\n\r\n  _Enter ARIEL._\r\n\r\n_Ari._ What would my potent master? here I am.\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service               35\r\nDid worthily perform; and I must use you\r\nIn such another trick. Go bring the rabble,\r\nOâer whom I give thee power, here to this place:\r\nIncite them to quick motion; for I must\r\nBestow upon the eyes of this young couple                           40\r\nSome vanity of mine art: it is my promise,\r\nAnd they expect it from me.\r\n\r\n_Ari._                    Presently?\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Ay, with a twink.\r\n\r\n_Ari._ Before you can say, âcome,â and âgo,â\r\n            And breathe twice, and cry, âso, so,â                   45\r\n            Each one, tripping on his toe,\r\n            Will be here with mop and mow.\r\n            Do you love me, master? no?\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Dearly, my delicate Ariel.

[_Exit._            50\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Look thou be true; do not give dalliance\r\nToo much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw\r\nTo the fire iâ the blood: be more abstemious,\r\nOr else, good night your vow!\r\n\r\n_Fer._                      I warrant you, sir;\r\nThe white cold virgin snow upon my heart                            55\r\nAbates the ardour of my liver.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                      Well.\r\nNow come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,\r\nRather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly!\r\nNo tongue! all eyes! be silent.                  [_Soft music._\r\n\r\n    _Enter IRIS._\r\n\r\n  _Iris._ Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas                 60\r\n    Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and pease;\r\n    Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\r\n    And flat meads thatchâd with stover, them to keep;\r\n    Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,\r\n    Which spongy April at thy best betrims,                         65\r\n    To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,\r\n    Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,\r\n    Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard;\r\n    And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,\r\n    Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen oâ the sky,             70\r\n    Whose watery arch and messenger am I,\r\n    Bids thee leave these; and with her sovereign grace,\r\n    Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,\r\n    To come and sport:--her peacocks fly amain:\r\n    Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.                         75\r\n\r\n    _Enter CERES._\r\n\r\n  _Cer._ Hail, many-colourâd messenger, that neâer\r\n    Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;\r\n    Who, with thy saffron wings, upon my flowers\r\n    Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers;\r\n    And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown                    80\r\n    My bosky acres and my unshrubbâd down,\r\n    Rich scarf to my proud earth;--why hath thy queen\r\n    Summonâd me hither, to this short-grassâd green?\r\n\r\n  _Iris._ A contract of true love to celebrate;\r\n    And some donation freely to estate                              85\r\n    On the blest lovers.\r\n\r\n  _Cer._             Tell me, heavenly bow,\r\n    If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,\r\n    Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot\r\n    The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,\r\n    Her and her blind boyâs scandalâd company                       90\r\n    I have forsworn.\r\n\r\n  _Iris._        Of her society\r\n    Be not afraid: I met her Deity\r\n    Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son\r\n    Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done\r\n    Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,                       95\r\n    Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid\r\n    Till Hymenâs torch be lighted: but in vain;\r\n    Marsâs hot minion is returned again;\r\n    Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,\r\n    Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,          100\r\n    And be a boy right out.\r\n\r\n  _Cer._                Highâst queen of state,\r\n    Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.\r\n\r\n    _Enter JUNO._\r\n\r\n  _Juno._ How does my bounteous sister? Go with me\r\n    To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,\r\n    And honourâd in their issue.         [_They sing:_             105\r\n\r\n  _Juno._ Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,\r\n            Long continuance, and increasing,\r\n            Hourly joys be still upon you!\r\n            Juno sings her blessings on you.\r\n\r\n  _Cer._  Earthâs increase, foison plenty,                         110\r\n            Barns and garners never empty;\r\n            Vines with clustering bunches growing;\r\n            Plants with goodly burthen bowing;\r\n            Spring come to you at the farthest\r\n            In the very end of harvest!                            115\r\n            Scarcity and want shall shun you;\r\n            Ceresâ blessing so is on you.\r\n\r\n_Fer._ This is a most majestic vision, and\r\nHarmonious charmingly.

We are such stuff\r\nAs dreams are made on; and our little life\r\nIs rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexâd;\r\nBear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:\r\nBe not disturbâd with my infirmity:                                160\r\nIf you be pleased, retire into my cell,\r\nAnd there repose: a turn or two Iâll walk,\r\nTo still my beating mind.\r\n\r\n_Fer._ _Mir._           We wish your peace.    [_Exeunt._\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Come with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel: come.\r\n\r\n  _Enter ARIEL._\r\n\r\n_Ari._ Thy thoughts I cleave to.

Then I beat my tabor;                       175\r\nAt which, like unbackâd colts, they prickâd their ears,\r\nAdvanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses\r\nAs they smelt music: so I charmâd their ears,\r\nThat, calf-like, they my lowing followâd through\r\nToothâd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,           180\r\nWhich enterâd their frail shins: at last I left them\r\nIâ the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,\r\nThere dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake\r\nOâerstunk their feet.\r\n\r\n_Pros._             This was well done, my bird.\r\nThy shape invisible retain thou still:                             185\r\nThe trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,\r\nFor stale to catch these thieves.\r\n\r\n_Ari._                          I go, I go.    [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Pros._ A devil, a born devil, on whose nature\r\nNurture can never stick; on whom my pains,\r\nHumanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;                         190\r\nAnd as with age his body uglier grows,\r\nSo his mind cankers.

Do you hear, monster? If I should               200\r\ntake a displeasure against you, look you,--\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Thou wert but a lost monster.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Good my lord, give me thy favour still.\r\nBe patient, for the prize Iâll bring thee to\r\nShall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.             205\r\nAllâs hushâd as midnight yet.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--\r\n\r\n_Ste._ There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,\r\nmonster, but an infinite loss.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Thatâs more to me than my wetting: yet this is             210\r\nyour harmless fairy, monster.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ I will fetch off my bottle, though I be oâer ears for\r\nmy labour.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Prithee, my king, be quiet.

I do begin to have bloody\r\nthoughts.                                                          220\r\n\r\n_Trin._ O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!\r\nlook what a wardrobe here is for thee!\r\n\r\n_Cal._ Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.\r\nO King Stephano!                                                   225\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, Iâll\r\nhave that gown.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Thy Grace shall have it.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ The dropsy drown this fool! what do you mean\r\nTo dote thus on such luggage? Letâs alone,                         230\r\nAnd do the murder first: if he awake,\r\nFrom toe to crown heâll fill our skins with pinches,\r\nMake us strange stuff.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this\r\nmy jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line: now, jerkin,          235\r\nyou are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Do, do: we steal by line and level, anât like your\r\nGrace.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ I thank thee for that jest; hereâs a garment forât:\r\nwit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country.       240\r\nâSteal by line and levelâ is an excellent pass of pate;\r\nthereâs another garment forât.\r\n\r\n_Trin._ Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,\r\nand away with the rest.\r\n\r\n_Cal._ I will have none onât: we shall lose our time,              245\r\nAnd all be turnâd to barnacles, or to apes\r\nWith foreheads villanous low.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this\r\naway where my hogshead of wine is, or Iâll turn you out\r\nof my kingdom: go to, carry this.                                  250\r\n\r\n_Trin._ And this.\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Ay, and this.\r\n\r\n  _A noise of hunters heard.

Howâs the day?\r\n\r\n_Ari._ On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,\r\nYou said our work should cease.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                       I did say so,                          5\r\nWhen first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,\r\nHow fares the king andâs followers?\r\n\r\n_Ari._                            Confined together\r\nIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,\r\nJust as you left them; all prisoners, sir,\r\nIn the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;                    10\r\nThey cannot budge till your release. The king,\r\nHis brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,\r\nAnd the remainder mourning over them,\r\nBrimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly\r\nHim that you termâd, sir, âThe good old lord, Gonzalo;â             15\r\nHis tears run down his beard, like winterâs drops\r\nFrom eaves of reeds.

Go release them, Ariel:                        30\r\nMy charms Iâll break, their senses Iâll restore,\r\nAnd they shall be themselves.\r\n\r\n_Ari._                      Iâll fetch them, sir.    [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves;\r\nAnd ye that on the sands with printless foot\r\nDo chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him                         35\r\nWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets that\r\nBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\r\nWhereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime\r\nIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\r\nTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid--                           40\r\nWeak masters though ye be--I have bedimmâd\r\nThe noontide sun, callâd forth the mutinous winds.\r\nAnd âtwixt the green sea and the azured vault\r\nSet roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder\r\nHave I given fire, and rifted Joveâs stout oak                      45\r\nWith his own bolt; the strong-based promontory\r\nHave I made shake, and by the spurs pluckâd up\r\nThe pine and cedar: graves at my command\r\nHave waked their sleepers, oped, and let âem forth\r\nBy my so potent art. But this rough magic                           50\r\nI here abjure; and, when I have required\r\nSome heavenly music,--which even now I do,--\r\nTo work mine end upon their senses, that\r\nThis airy charm is for, Iâll break my staff,\r\nBury it certain fathoms in the earth,                               55\r\nAnd deeper than did ever plummet sound\r\nIâll drown my book.                    [_Solemn music._\r\n\r\n  _Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture,\r\n  attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,\r\n  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO: they all enter the circle\r\n  which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO\r\n  observing, speaks:_\r\n\r\nA solemn air, and the best comforter\r\nTo an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,\r\nNow useless, boilâd within thy skull! There stand,                  60\r\nFor you are spell-stoppâd.\r\nHoly Gonzalo, honourable man,\r\nMine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,\r\nFall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace;\r\nAnd as the morning steals upon the night,                           65\r\nMelting the darkness, so their rising senses\r\nBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\r\nTheir clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,\r\nMy true preserver, and a loyal sir\r\nTo him thou followâst! I will pay thy graces                        70\r\nHome both in word and deed. Most cruelly\r\nDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:\r\nThy brother was a furtherer in the act.\r\nThou art pinchâd forât now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,\r\nYou, brother mine, that entertainâd ambition,                       75\r\nExpellâd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,--\r\nWhose inward pinches therefore are most strong,--\r\nWould here have killâd your king; I do forgive thee,\r\nUnnatural though thou art. Their understanding\r\nBegins to swell; and the approaching tide                           80\r\nWill shortly fill the reasonable shore,\r\nThat now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them\r\nThat yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel,\r\nFetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:\r\nI will discase me, and myself present                               85\r\nAs I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;\r\nThou shalt ere long be free.\r\n\r\n_ARIEL sings and helps to attire him._\r\n\r\n    Where the bee sucks, there suck I:\r\n    In a cowslipâs bell I lie;\r\n    There I couch when owls do cry.                                 90\r\n    On the batâs back I do fly\r\n    After summer merrily.\r\nMerrily, merrily shall I live now\r\nUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough.\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Why, thatâs my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;             95\r\nBut yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.\r\nTo the kingâs ship, invisible as thou art:\r\nThere shalt thou find the mariners asleep\r\nUnder the hatches; the master and the boatswain\r\nBeing awake, enforce them to this place,                           100\r\nAnd presently, I prithee.\r\n\r\n_Ari._ I drink the air before me, and return\r\nOr ere your pulse twice beat.    [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Gon._ All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement\r\nInhabits here: some heavenly power guide us                        105\r\nOut of this fearful country!\r\n\r\n_Pros._                    Behold, sir king,\r\nThe wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:\r\nFor more assurance that a living prince\r\nDoes now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;\r\nAnd to thee and thy company I bid                                  110\r\nA hearty welcome.\r\n\r\n_Alon._         Whether thou beâst he or no,\r\nOr some enchanted trifle to abuse me,\r\nAs late I have been, I not know: thy pulse\r\nBeats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,\r\nThe affliction of my mind amends, with which,                      115\r\nI fear, a madness held me: this must crave--\r\nAn if this be at all--a most strange story.\r\nThy dukedom I resign, and do entreat\r\nThou pardon me my wrongs. --But how should Prospero\r\nBe living and be here?\r\n\r\n_Pros._              First, noble friend,                          120\r\nLet me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot\r\nBe measured or confined.\r\n\r\n_Gon._                 Whether this be\r\nOr be not, Iâll not swear.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                  You do yet taste\r\nSome subtilties oâ the isle, that will not let you\r\nBelieve things certain. Welcome, my friends all!                   125\r\n[_Aside to Seb. and Ant._]\r\n    But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,\r\nI here could pluck his Highnessâ frown upon you,\r\nAnd justify you traitors: at this time\r\nI will tell no tales.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ [_Aside_]    The devil speaks in him.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                                    No.\r\nFor you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother                     130\r\nWould even infect my mouth, I do forgive\r\nThy rankest fault,--all of them; and require\r\nMy dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,\r\nThou must restore.\r\n\r\n_Alon._          If thou beâst Prospero,\r\nGive us particulars of thy preservation;                           135\r\nHow thou hast met us here, who three hours since\r\nWere wreckâd upon this shore; where I have lost--\r\nHow sharp the point of this remembrance is!--\r\nMy dear son Ferdinand.\r\n\r\n_Pros._              I am woe forât, sir.\r\n\r\n_Alon._ Irreparable is the loss; and patience                      140\r\nSays it is past her cure.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                 I rather think\r\nYou have not sought her help, of whose soft grace\r\nFor the like loss I have her sovereign aid,\r\nAnd rest myself content.\r\n\r\n_Alon._                You the like loss!\r\n\r\n_Pros._ As great to me as late; and, supportable                   145\r\nTo make the dear loss, have I means much weaker\r\nThan you may call to comfort you, for I\r\nHave lost my daughter.\r\n\r\n_Alon._              A daughter?\r\nO heavens, that they were living both in Naples,\r\nThe king and queen there! that they were, I wish                   150\r\nMyself were mudded in that oozy bed\r\nWhere my son lies. When did you lose you daughter?\r\n\r\n_Pros._ In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords\r\nAt this encounter do so much admire,\r\nThat they devour their reason, and scarce think                    155\r\nTheir eyes do offices of truth, their words\r\nAre natural breath: but, howsoeâer you have\r\nBeen justled from your senses, know for certain\r\nThat I am Prospero, and that very duke\r\nWhich was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely                160\r\nUpon this shore, where you were wreckâd, was landed,\r\nTo be the Lord onât. No more yet of this;\r\nFor âtis a chronicle of day by day,\r\nNot a relation for a breakfast, nor\r\nBefitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;                        165\r\nThis cellâs my court: here have I few attendants,\r\nAnd subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.\r\nMy dukedom since you have given me again,\r\nI will requite you with as good a thing;\r\nAt least bring forth a wonder, to content ye                       170\r\nAs much as me my dukedom.\r\n\r\n  _Here Prospero discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess._\r\n\r\n_Mir._ Sweet lord, you play me false.\r\n\r\n_Fer._                              No, my dearâst love,\r\nI would not for the world.\r\n\r\n_Mir._ Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,\r\nAnd I would call it fair play.\r\n\r\n_Alon._                      If this prove                         175\r\nA vision of the island, one dear son\r\nShall I twice lose.\r\n\r\n_Seb._            A most high miracle!\r\n\r\n_Fer._ Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;\r\nI have cursed them without cause.               [_Kneels._\r\n\r\n_Alon._                          Now all the blessings\r\nOf a glad father compass thee about!                               180\r\nArise, and say how thou camest here.\r\n\r\n_Mir._                             O, wonder!\r\nHow many goodly creatures are there here!\r\nHow beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,\r\nThat has such people inât!\r\n\r\n_Pros._                  âTis new to thee.\r\n\r\n_Alon._ What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?             185\r\nYour eldâst acquaintance cannot be three hours:\r\nIs she the goddess that hath severâd us,\r\nAnd brought us thus together?\r\n\r\n_Fer._                      Sir, she is mortal;\r\nBut by immortal Providence sheâs mine:\r\nI chose her when I could not ask my father                         190\r\nFor his advice, nor thought I had one. She\r\nIs daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,\r\nOf whom so often I have heard renown,\r\nBut never saw before; of whom I have\r\nReceived a second life; and second father                          195\r\nThis lady makes him to me.\r\n\r\n_Alon._                  I am hers:\r\nBut, O, how oddly will it sound that I\r\nMust ask my child forgiveness!\r\n\r\n_Pros._                      There, sir, stop:\r\nLet us not burthen our remembrances with\r\nA heaviness thatâs gone.\r\n\r\n_Gon._                 I have inly wept,                           200\r\nOr should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,\r\nAnd on this couple drop a blessed crown!\r\nFor it is you that have chalkâd forth the way\r\nWhich brought us hither.\r\n\r\n_Alon._                I say, Amen, Gonzalo!\r\n\r\n_Gon._ Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue                 205\r\nShould become kings of Naples? O, rejoice\r\nBeyond a common joy! and set it down\r\nWith gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage\r\nDid Claribel her husband find at Tunis,\r\nAnd Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife                           210\r\nWhere he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom\r\nIn a poor isle, and all of us ourselves\r\nWhen no man was his own.\r\n\r\n_Alon._ [_to Fer. and Mir._] Give me your hands:\r\nLet grief and sorrow still embrace his heart\r\nThat doth not wish you joy!\r\n\r\n_Gon._                    Be it so! Amen!                          215\r\n\r\n  _Re-enter ARIEL, with the _Master_ and _Boatswain_ amazedly\r\n  following._\r\n\r\nO, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:\r\nI prophesied, if a gallows were on land,\r\nThis fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,\r\nThat swearâst grace oâerboard, not an oath on shore?\r\nHast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?                      220\r\n\r\n_Boats._ The best news is, that we have safely found\r\nOur king and company; the next, our ship--\r\nWhich, but three glasses since, we gave out split--\r\nIs tight and yare and bravely riggâd, as when\r\nWe first put out to sea.\r\n\r\n_Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Sir, all this service                    225\r\nHave I done since I went.\r\n\r\n_Pros._ [_Aside to Ari._] My tricksy spirit!\r\n\r\n_Alon._ These are not natural events; they strengthen\r\nFrom strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?\r\n\r\n_Boats._ If I did think, sir, I were well awake,\r\nIâld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,                    230\r\nAnd--how we know not--all clappâd under hatches;\r\nWhere, but even now, with strange and several noises\r\nOf roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,\r\nAnd more diversity of sounds, all horrible,\r\nWe were awaked; straightway, at liberty;                           235\r\nWhere we, in all her trim, freshly beheld\r\nOur royal, good, and gallant ship; our master\r\nCapering to eye her:--on a trice, so please you,\r\nEven in a dream, were we divided from them,\r\nAnd were brought moping hither.\r\n\r\n_Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Wasât well done?                         240\r\n\r\n_Pros._ [_Aside to Ari._] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.\r\n\r\n_Alon._ This is as strange a maze as eâer men trod;\r\nAnd there is in this business more than nature\r\nWas ever conduct of: some oracle\r\nMust rectify our knowledge.\r\n\r\n_Pros._                   Sir, my liege,                           245\r\nDo not infest your mind with beating on\r\nThe strangeness of this business; at pickâd leisure\r\nWhich shall be shortly, single Iâll resolve you,\r\nWhich to you shall seem probable, of every\r\nThese happenâd accidents; till when, be cheerful,                  250\r\nAnd think of each thing well.\r\n    [_Aside to Ari._] Come hither, spirit:\r\nSet Caliban and his companions free;\r\nUntie the spell. [_Exit Ariel._] How fares my gracious sir?\r\nThere are yet missing of your company\r\nSome few odd lads that you remember not.                           255\r\n\r\n  _Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO,\r\n  in their stolen apparel._\r\n\r\n_Ste._ Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man\r\ntake care for himself; for all is but fortune. --Coragio,\r\nbully-monster, coragio!\r\n\r\n_Trin._ If these be true spies which I wear in my head,\r\nhereâs a goodly sight.                                             260\r\n\r\n_Cal._ O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!\r\nHow fine my master is! I am afraid\r\nHe will chastise me.\r\n\r\n_Seb._             Ha, ha!\r\nWhat things are these, my lord Antonio?\r\nWill money buy âem?\r\n\r\n_Ant._            Very like; one of them                           265\r\nIs a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,\r\nThen say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,\r\nHis mother was a witch; and one so strong\r\nThat could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,                  270\r\nAnd deal in her command, without her power.\r\nThese three have robbâd me; and this demi-devil--\r\nFor heâs a bastard one--had plotted with them\r\nTo take my life. Two of these fellows you\r\nMust know and own; this thing of darkness I                        275\r\nAcknowledge mine.\r\n\r\n_Cal._          I shall be pinchâd to death.\r\n\r\n_Alon._ Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?\r\n\r\n_Seb._ He is drunk now: where had he wine?\r\n\r\n_Alon._ And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they\r\nFind this grand liquor that hath gilded âem?--                     280\r\nHow camest thou in this pickle?\r\n\r\n_Trin._ I have been in such a pickle, since I saw you\r\nlast, that, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I shall not\r\nfear fly-blowing.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Why, how now, Stephano!                                     285\r\n\r\n_Ste._ O, touch me not;--I am not Stephano, but a cramp.\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Youâld be king oâ the isle, sirrah?\r\n\r\n_Ste._ I should have been a sore one, then.\r\n\r\n_Alon._ This is a strange thing as eâer I lookâd on.\r\n                                [_Pointing to Caliban._\r\n\r\n_Pros._ He is as disproportionâd in his manners                    290\r\nAs in his shape.

What a thrice-double ass                       295\r\nWas I, to take this drunkard for a god,\r\nAnd worship this dull fool!\r\n\r\n_Pros._                Go to; away!\r\n\r\n_Alon._ Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.\r\n\r\n_Seb._ Or stole it, rather.    [_Exeunt Cal., Ste., and Trin._\r\n\r\n_Pros._ Sir, I invite your Highness and your train                 300\r\nTo my poor cell, where you shall take your rest\r\nFor this one night; which, part of it, Iâll waste\r\nWith such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it\r\nGo quick away: the story of my life,\r\nAnd the particular accidents gone by                               305\r\nSince I came to this isle: and in the morn\r\nIâll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,\r\nWhere I have hope to see the nuptial\r\nOf these our dear-beloved solemnized;\r\nAnd thence retire me to my Milan, where                            310\r\nEvery third thought shall be my grave.\r\n\r\n_Alon._                              I long\r\nTo hear the story of your life, which must\r\nTake the ear strangely.\r\n\r\n_Pros._               Iâll deliver all;\r\nAnd promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,\r\nAnd sail so expeditious, that shall catch\r\nYour royal fleet far off.

Similar cases occur frequently, especially when the verb precedes\r\nits nominative. For example, _Tempest_, IV. 1. 262, âLies at my mercy\r\nall mine enemies,â and _Measure for Measure_, II. 1. 22, âWhat knows the\r\nlaws, &c.â We correct it in those passages where the occurrence of a\r\nvulgarism would be likely to annoy the reader. In the mouth of a\r\nBoatswain it can offend no one. We therefore leave it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE II.\r\n\r\nI. 1. 57-59. _Mercy on us!--we split, &c._ It may be doubtful whether\r\nthe printer of the first folio intended these broken speeches to express\r\nâa confused noise within.â Without question such was the authorâs\r\nmeaning. Rowe, however, and subsequent editors, printed them as part of\r\nGonzaloâs speech. Capell was the first editor who gave the true\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE III.\r\n\r\nI. 2. 173. _princesses._ See Mr Sidney Walkerâs _Shakespeareâs\r\nVersification_, p. 243 sqq. âThe plurals of substantives ending in _s_,\r\nin certain instances, in _se_, _ss_, _ce_, and sometimes _ge_, ... are\r\nfound without the usual addition of _s_ or _es_, in pronunciation at\r\nleast, although in many instances the plural affix is added in printing,\r\nwhere the metre shows that it is not to be pronounced.â\r\n\r\nIn this and other instances, we have thought it better to trust to the\r\near of the reader for the rhythm than to introduce an innovation in\r\northography which might perplex him as to the sense. The form\r\nâprincesses,â the use of which in Shakespeareâs time was doubted by one\r\nof our correspondents, is found in the _History of King Leir_.\r\n\r\nRoweâs reading âprincesâ might be defended on the ground that the\r\nsentiment is general, and applicable to royal children of both sexes; or\r\nthat Sir Philip Sidney, in the first book of the _Arcadia_, calls Pamela\r\nand Philoclea âprinces.â\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE IV.\r\n\r\nI. 2. 298. The metre of this line, as well as of lines 301, 302, is\r\ndefective, but as no mode of correction can be regarded as completely\r\nsatisfactory we have in accordance with our custom left the lines as\r\nthey are printed in the Folio. The defect, indeed, in the metre of line\r\n298 has not been noticed except by Hanmer, who makes a line thus:\r\n\r\n  âDo so, and after two days Iâll discharge thee.â\r\n\r\nPossibly it ought to be printed thus:\r\n\r\n              âDo so; and\r\n  After two days\r\n  I will discharge thee.â\r\n\r\nThere is a broken line, also of four syllables, 253 of the same scene,\r\nanother of seven, 235.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt that the _words_ are as Shakespeare wrote\r\nthem, for, although the action of the play terminates in less than four\r\nhours (I. 2. 240 and V. 1. 186), yet Arielâs ministry is not to end till\r\nthe voyage to Naples shall be over. Prospero, too, repeats his promise,\r\nand marks his contentment by further shortening the time of servitude,\r\nâwithin two days,â I. 2. 420. Possibly âInvisibleâ (301) should have a\r\nline to itself. Words thus occupying a broken line acquire a marked\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is that in dialogue Shakespeareâs language passes so\r\nrapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even\r\nhovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than\r\nmetrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made\r\nwith diffidence and received with doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE V.\r\n\r\nI. 2. 377, 378:\r\n\r\n  _Courtsied when you have and kissâd_\r\n  _The wild waves whist._\r\n\r\nThis punctuation seems to be supported by what Ferdinand says (391,\r\n392):\r\n\r\n  âThe music crept by me upon the waters,\r\n  Allaying both their fury and my passion, &c.â\r\n\r\nAt the end of the stanza we have printed _Hark, hark! ... The watch-dogs\r\nbark_ as that part of the burthen which âsweet sprites bear.â The other\r\npart is borne by distant watch-dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE VI.\r\n\r\nI. 2. 443. _I fear you have done yourself some wrong._ See this phrase\r\nused in a similar sense, _Measure for Measure_, I. 11. 39.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE VII.\r\n\r\nII. 1. 27. _Which, of he or Adrian._ âOfâ is found in the same\r\nconstruction, _Midsummer Nightâs Dream_, III. 2. 336,\r\n\r\n  âNow follow if thou darest to try whose right,\r\n  Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.â\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE VIII.\r\n\r\nII. 1. 157. _Of its own kind._ There is no doubt, as Dr Guest has shewn,\r\nthat âit,â which is the reading of the 1st and 2nd folios, was commonly\r\nused as a genitive in Shakespeareâs time, as it is still in some\r\nprovincial dialects. âIts,â however, was coming into use. One instance\r\noccurs in this play, I. 11. 95, âin its contrary.â\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE IX.\r\n\r\nII. 1. 241. _she that from whom._ Mr Spedding writes: âThe received\r\nemendation is not satisfactory to me. I would rather read, âShe\r\nthat--From whom? All were sea-swallowâd &c., i.e. from whom should she\r\nhave note? The report from Naples will be that all were drowned. We\r\nshall be the only survivors.â The break in the construction seems to me\r\ncharacteristic of the speaker. But you must read the whole speech to\r\nfeel the effect.â\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE X.\r\n\r\nII. 1. 249-251. All editors except Mr Staunton have printed in italics\r\n(or between inverted commas) only as far as â_Naples?_â, but as â_keep_â\r\nis printed with a small k in the folios, they seem to sanction the\r\narrangement given in our text.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE XI.\r\n\r\nII. 1. 267. _Ay, sir; where lies that? if âtwere a kibe._ Mr Singer and\r\nMr Dyce have changed ââtwereâ to âit wereâ for the sake of the metre.\r\nBut then the first part of the line must be read with a wrong emphasis.\r\nThe proper emphasis clearly falls on the first, third, and fifth\r\nsyllables, âAÃ½, sir; whÃ©re lies thÃ¡t?â See Preface.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE XII.\r\n\r\nII. 2. 165. Before âhere; bear my bottleâ Capell inserts a stage\r\ndirection [_To Cal._], but it appears from III. 2. 62, that Trinculo was\r\nentrusted with the office of bottle-bearer.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE XIII.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. 15. _Most busy lest, when I do it._ As none of the proposed\r\nemendations can be regarded as certain, we have left the reading of F1,\r\nthough it is manifestly corrupt. The spelling âdoeâ makes Mr Speddingâs\r\nconjecture âidlestâ for âI doe itâ more probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE XIV.\r\n\r\nIII. 3. 17. The stage direction, which we have divided into two parts,\r\nis placed all at once in the folios after âas when they are freshâ\r\n[Solemne and strange Musicke; and Prosper on the top (invisible:) Enter\r\n... depart].\r\n\r\nPope transferred it to follow Sebastianâs words, âI say, to night: no\r\nmore.â\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE XV.\r\n\r\nIII. 3. 48. _Each putter out of five for one._ See Beaumont and\r\nFletcher, _The Noble Gentleman_, I. 1. (Vol. II. p. 261, ed. Moxon):\r\nâThe return will give you five for one.â MARINE is about to travel.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE XVI.\r\n\r\nIV. 1. 146. _You do look, my son, in a moved sort._ Seymour suggests a\r\ntransposition: âyou do, my son, look in a moved sort.â This line however\r\ncan scarcely have come from Shakespeareâs pen. Perhaps the writer who\r\ncomposed the Masque was allowed to join it, as best he might, to\r\nShakespeareâs words, which re-commence at âOur revels now are ended,â\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE XVII.\r\n\r\nIV. 1. 230. _Letâs alone._ See Stauntonâs âShakespeare,â Vol. I. p. 81,\r\nnote (b).\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE XVIII.\r\n\r\nV. 1. 309. _Of these our dear-beloved solemnized._ The Folios have\r\nâbelovâdâ; a mode of spelling, which in this case is convenient as\r\nindicating the probable rhythm of the verse. We have written âbeloved,â\r\nin accordance with the general rule mentioned in the Preface.\r\n\r\nâSolemnizedâ occurs in four other verse passages of Shakespeare. It is\r\nthree times to be accented âsÃ³lemnizedâ and once (_Loveâs Labourâs\r\nLost_, II. 1. 41) âsolÃ©mnized.â\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n\r\nThe editorsâ Preface (e-text 23041) discusses the 17th- and\r\n18th-century editions in detail; the newer (19th-century) editions\r\nare simply listed by name.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"},{"filename":"The Tragedie of Macbeth.txt","text":"ï»¿The Tragedie of Macbeth\r\n\r\nActus Primus.

My Noble Partner\r\nYou greet with present Grace, and great prediction\r\nOf Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,\r\nThat he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.\r\nIf you can looke into the Seedes of Time,\r\nAnd say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,\r\nSpeake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare\r\nYour fauors, nor your hate\r\n\r\n   1.

Say from whence\r\nYou owe this strange Intelligence, or why\r\nVpon this blasted Heath you stop our way\r\nWith such Prophetique greeting?\r\nSpeake, I charge you.\r\n\r\nWitches vanish.\r\n\r\n  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,\r\nAnd these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?\r\n  Macb.

Were such things here, as we doe speake about?\r\nOr haue we eaten on the insane Root,\r\nThat takes the Reason Prisoner?\r\n  Macb. Your Children shall be Kings\r\n\r\n   Banq.

Wee are sent,\r\nTo giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,\r\nOnely to harrold thee into his sight,\r\nNot pay thee\r\n\r\n   Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater Honor,\r\nHe bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:\r\nIn which addition, haile most worthy Thane,\r\nFor it is thine\r\n\r\n   Banq. What, can the Deuill speake true?\r\n  Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:\r\nWhy doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?\r\n  Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,\r\nBut vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,\r\nWhich he deserues to loose.\r\nWhether he was combin'd with those of Norway,\r\nOr did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,\r\nAnd vantage; or that with both he labour'd\r\nIn his Countreyes wracke, I know not:\r\nBut Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,\r\nHaue ouerthrowne him\r\n\r\n   Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:\r\nThe greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.\r\nDoe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,\r\nWhen those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,\r\nPromis'd no lesse to them\r\n\r\n   Banq. That trusted home,\r\nMight yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,\r\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:\r\nAnd oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,\r\nThe Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,\r\nWinne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's\r\nIn deepest consequence.\r\nCousins, a word, I pray you\r\n\r\n   Macb. Two Truths are told,\r\nAs happy Prologues to the swelling Act\r\nOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:\r\nThis supernaturall solliciting\r\nCannot be ill; cannot be good.\r\nIf ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,\r\nCommencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.\r\nIf good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,\r\nWhose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,\r\nAnd make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,\r\nAgainst the vse of Nature? Present Feares\r\nAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:\r\nMy Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,\r\nShakes so my single state of Man,\r\nThat Function is smother'd in surmise,\r\nAnd nothing is, but what is not\r\n\r\n   Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt\r\n\r\n   Macb. If Chance will haue me King,\r\nWhy Chance may Crowne me,\r\nWithout my stirre\r\n\r\n   Banq. New Honors come vpon him\r\nLike our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,\r\nBut with the aid of vse\r\n\r\n   Macb. Come what come may,\r\nTime, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day\r\n\r\n   Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure\r\n\r\n   Macb. Giue me your fauour:\r\nMy dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.\r\nKinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,\r\nWhere euery day I turne the Leafe,\r\nTo reade them.\r\nLet vs toward the King: thinke vpon\r\nWhat hath chanc'd: and at more time,\r\nThe Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake\r\nOur free Hearts each to other\r\n\r\n   Banq. Very gladly\r\n\r\n   Macb. Till then enough:\r\nCome friends.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Quarta.\r\n\r\nFlourish. Enter King, Lenox, Malcolme, Donalbaine, and\r\nAttendants.\r\n\r\n  King. Is execution done on Cawdor?\r\nOr not those in Commission yet return'd?\r\n  Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.\r\nBut I haue spoke with one that saw him die:\r\nWho did report, that very frankly hee\r\nConfess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,\r\nAnd set forth a deepe Repentance:\r\nNothing in his Life became him,\r\nLike the leauing it. Hee dy'de,\r\nAs one that had beene studied in his death,\r\nTo throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,\r\nAs 'twere a carelesse Trifle\r\n\r\n   King. There's no Art,\r\nTo finde the Mindes construction in the Face.\r\nHe was a Gentleman, on whom I built\r\nAn absolute Trust.\r\nEnter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.\r\n\r\nO worthyest Cousin,\r\nThe sinne of my Ingratitude euen now\r\nWas heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,\r\nThat swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,\r\nTo ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,\r\nThat the proportion both of thanks, and payment,\r\nMight haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,\r\nMore is thy due, then more then all can pay\r\n\r\n   Macb. The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,\r\nIn doing it, payes it selfe.\r\nYour Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:\r\nAnd our Duties are to your Throne, and State,\r\nChildren, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,\r\nBy doing euery thing safe toward your Loue\r\nAnd Honor\r\n\r\n   King. Welcome hither:\r\nI haue begun to plant thee, and will labour\r\nTo make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,\r\nThat hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowne\r\nNo lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,\r\nAnd hold thee to my Heart\r\n\r\n   Banq. There if I grow,\r\nThe Haruest is your owne\r\n\r\n   King. My plenteous Ioyes,\r\nWanton in fulnesse, seeke to hide themselues\r\nIn drops of sorrow. Sonnes, Kinsmen, Thanes,\r\nAnd you whose places are the nearest, know,\r\nWe will establish our Estate vpon\r\nOur eldest, Malcolme, whom we name hereafter,\r\nThe Prince of Cumberland: which Honor must\r\nNot vnaccompanied, inuest him onely,\r\nBut signes of Noblenesse, like Starres, shall shine\r\nOn all deseruers. From hence to Envernes,\r\nAnd binde vs further to you\r\n\r\n   Macb. The Rest is Labor, which is not vs'd for you:\r\nIle be my selfe the Herbenger, and make ioyfull\r\nThe hearing of my Wife, with your approach:\r\nSo humbly take my leaue\r\n\r\n   King. My worthy Cawdor\r\n\r\n   Macb. The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,\r\nOn which I must fall downe, or else o're-leape,\r\nFor in my way it lyes. Starres hide your fires,\r\nLet not Light see my black and deepe desires:\r\nThe Eye winke at the Hand: yet let that bee,\r\nWhich the Eye feares, when it is done to see.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  King. True worthy Banquo: he is full so valiant,\r\nAnd in his commendations, I am fed:\r\nIt is a Banquet to me.

Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Quinta.\r\n\r\nEnter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter.\r\n\r\n  Lady. They met me in the day of successe: and I haue\r\nlearn'd by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, then\r\nmortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them\r\nfurther, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.\r\nWhiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from\r\nthe King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title\r\nbefore, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to\r\nthe comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This\r\nhaue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of\r\nGreatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing\r\nby being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Lay\r\nit to thy heart and farewell.\r\nGlamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be\r\nWhat thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,\r\nIt is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,\r\nTo catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great,\r\nArt not without Ambition, but without\r\nThe illnesse should attend it. What thou would'st highly,\r\nThat would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,\r\nAnd yet would'st wrongly winne.\r\nThould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes,\r\nThus thou must doe, if thou haue it;\r\nAnd that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,\r\nThen wishest should be vndone. High thee hither,\r\nThat I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare,\r\nAnd chastise with the valour of my Tongue\r\nAll that impeides thee from the Golden Round,\r\nWhich Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme\r\nTo haue thee crown'd withall.\r\nEnter Messenger.\r\n\r\nWhat is your tidings?\r\n  Mess. The King comes here to Night\r\n\r\n   Lady. Thou'rt mad to say it.\r\nIs not thy Master with him? who, wer't so,\r\nWould haue inform'd for preparation\r\n\r\n   Mess. So please you, it is true: our Thane is comming:\r\nOne of my fellowes had the speed of him;\r\nWho almost dead for breath, had scarcely more\r\nThen would make vp his Message\r\n\r\n   Lady. Giue him tending,\r\nHe brings great newes,\r\n\r\nExit Messenger.\r\n\r\nThe Rauen himselfe is hoarse,\r\nThat croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan\r\nVnder my Battlements. Come you Spirits,\r\nThat tend on mortall thoughts, vnsex me here,\r\nAnd fill me from the Crowne to the Toe, top-full\r\nOf direst Crueltie: make thick my blood,\r\nStop vp th' accesse, and passage to Remorse,\r\nThat no compunctious visitings of Nature\r\nShake my fell purpose, nor keepe peace betweene\r\nTh' effect, and hit. Come to my Womans Brests,\r\nAnd take my Milke for Gall, you murth'ring Ministers,\r\nWhere-euer, in your sightlesse substances,\r\nYou wait on Natures Mischiefe. Come thick Night,\r\nAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell,\r\n\r\nThat my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes,\r\nNor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke,\r\nTo cry, hold, hold.\r\nEnter Macbeth.\r\n\r\nGreat Glamys, worthy Cawdor,\r\nGreater then both, by the all-haile hereafter,\r\nThy Letters haue transported me beyond\r\nThis ignorant present, and I feele now\r\nThe future in the instant\r\n\r\n   Macb. My dearest Loue,\r\nDuncan comes here to Night\r\n\r\n   Lady. And when goes hence?\r\n  Macb. To morrow, as he purposes\r\n\r\n   Lady. O neuer,\r\nShall Sunne that Morrow see.\r\nYour Face, my Thane, is as a Booke, where men\r\nMay reade strange matters, to beguile the time.\r\nLooke like the time, beare welcome in your Eye,\r\nYour Hand, your Tongue: looke like th' innocent flower,\r\nBut be the Serpent vnder't. He that's comming,\r\nMust be prouided for: and you shall put\r\nThis Nights great Businesse into my dispatch,\r\nWhich shall to all our Nights, and Dayes to come,\r\nGiue solely soueraigne sway, and Masterdome\r\n\r\n   Macb. We will speake further,\r\n  Lady. Onely looke vp cleare:\r\nTo alter fauor, euer is to feare:\r\nLeaue all the rest to me.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Sexta.\r\n\r\nHoboyes, and Torches. Enter King, Malcolme, Donalbaine,\r\nBanquo, Lenox,\r\nMacduff, Rosse, Angus, and Attendants.\r\n\r\n  King. This Castle hath a pleasant seat,\r\nThe ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe\r\nVnto our gentle sences\r\n\r\n   Banq. This Guest of Summer,\r\nThe Temple-haunting Barlet does approue,\r\nBy his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath\r\nSmells wooingly here: no Iutty frieze,\r\nButtrice, nor Coigne of Vantage, but this Bird\r\nHath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,\r\nWhere they must breed, and haunt: I haue obseru'd\r\nThe ayre is delicate.\r\nEnter Lady.\r\n\r\n  King. See, see our honor'd Hostesse:\r\nThe Loue that followes vs, sometime is our trouble,\r\nWhich still we thanke as Loue. Herein I teach you,\r\nHow you shall bid God-eyld vs for your paines,\r\nAnd thanke vs for your trouble\r\n\r\n   Lady. All our seruice,\r\nIn euery point twice done, and then done double,\r\nWere poore, and single Businesse, to contend\r\nAgainst those Honors deepe, and broad,\r\nWherewith your Maiestie loades our House:\r\nFor those of old, and the late Dignities,\r\nHeap'd vp to them, we rest your Ermites\r\n\r\n   King. Where's the Thane of Cawdor?\r\nWe courst him at the heeles, and had a purpose\r\nTo be his Purueyor: But he rides well,\r\nAnd his great Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him\r\nTo his home before vs: Faire and Noble Hostesse\r\nWe are your guest to night\r\n\r\n   La. Your Seruants euer,\r\nHaue theirs, themselues, and what is theirs in compt,\r\nTo make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure,\r\nStill to returne your owne\r\n\r\n   King.

Torches. Enter a Sewer, and diuers Seruants with Dishes\r\nand\r\nSeruice ouer the Stage. Then enter Macbeth\r\n\r\n   Macb. If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well,\r\nIt were done quickly: If th' Assassination\r\nCould trammell vp the Consequence, and catch\r\nWith his surcease, Successe: that but this blow\r\nMight be the be all, and the end all. Heere,\r\nBut heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,\r\nWee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,\r\nWe still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach\r\nBloody Instructions, which being taught, returne\r\nTo plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice\r\nCommends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice\r\nTo our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;\r\nFirst, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,\r\nStrong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,\r\nWho should against his Murtherer shut the doore,\r\nNot beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane\r\nHath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath bin\r\nSo cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues\r\nWill pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against\r\nThe deepe damnation of his taking off:\r\nAnd Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,\r\nStriding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd\r\nVpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,\r\nShall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,\r\nThat teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no Spurre\r\nTo pricke the sides of my intent, but onely\r\nVaulting Ambition, which ore-leapes it selfe,\r\nAnd falles on th' other.\r\nEnter Lady.\r\n\r\nHow now? What Newes?\r\n  La. He has almost supt: why haue you left the chamber?\r\n  Mac. Hath he ask'd for me?\r\n  La. Know you not, he ha's?\r\n  Mac. We will proceed no further in this Businesse:\r\nHe hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought\r\nGolden Opinions from all sorts of people,\r\nWhich would be worne now in their newest glosse,\r\nNot cast aside so soone\r\n\r\n   La. Was the hope drunke,\r\nWherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?\r\nAnd wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,\r\nAt what it did so freely? From this time,\r\nSuch I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd\r\nTo be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,\r\nAs thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that\r\nWhich thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,\r\nAnd liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?\r\nLetting I dare not, wait vpon I would,\r\nLike the poore Cat i'th' Addage\r\n\r\n   Macb. Prythee peace:\r\nI dare do all that may become a man,\r\nWho dares do more, is none\r\n\r\n   La. What Beast was't then\r\nThat made you breake this enterprize to me?\r\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man:\r\nAnd to be more then what you were, you would\r\nBe so much more the man. Nor time, nor place\r\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both:\r\nThey haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now\r\nDo's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know\r\nHow tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,\r\nI would, while it was smyling in my Face,\r\nHaue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,\r\nAnd dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne\r\nAs you haue done to this\r\n\r\n   Macb. If we should faile?\r\n  Lady. We faile?\r\nBut screw your courage to the sticking place,\r\nAnd wee'le not fayle: when Duncan is asleepe,\r\n(Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney\r\nSoundly inuite him) his two Chamberlaines\r\nWill I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,\r\nThat Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,\r\nShall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason\r\nA Lymbeck onely: when in Swinish sleepe,\r\nTheir drenched Natures lyes as in a Death,\r\nWhat cannot you and I performe vpon\r\nTh' vnguarded Duncan? What not put vpon\r\nHis spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt\r\nOf our great quell\r\n\r\n   Macb. Bring forth Men-Children onely:\r\nFor thy vndaunted Mettle should compose\r\nNothing but Males. Will it not be receiu'd,\r\nWhen we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two\r\nOf his owne Chamber, and vs'd their very Daggers,\r\nThat they haue don't?\r\n  Lady. Who dares receiue it other,\r\nAs we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,\r\nVpon his Death?\r\n  Macb. I am settled, and bend vp\r\nEach corporall Agent to this terrible Feat.\r\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show,\r\nFalse Face must hide what the false Heart doth know.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nActus Secundus. Scena Prima.\r\n\r\nEnter Banquo, and Fleance, with a Torch before him.\r\n\r\n  Banq. How goes the Night, Boy?\r\n  Fleance. The Moone is downe: I haue not heard the\r\nClock\r\n\r\n   Banq. And she goes downe at Twelue\r\n\r\n   Fleance. I take't, 'tis later, Sir\r\n\r\n   Banq. Hold, take my Sword:\r\nThere's Husbandry in Heauen,\r\nTheir Candles are all out: take thee that too.\r\nA heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me,\r\nAnd yet I would not sleepe:\r\nMercifull Powers, restraine in me the cursed thoughts\r\nThat Nature giues way to in repose.\r\nEnter Macbeth, and a Seruant with a Torch.\r\n\r\nGiue me my Sword: who's there?\r\n  Macb. A Friend\r\n\r\n   Banq. What Sir, not yet at rest? the King's a bed.\r\nHe hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure,\r\nAnd sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.\r\nThis Diamond he greetes your Wife withall,\r\nBy the name of most kind Hostesse,\r\nAnd shut vp in measurelesse content\r\n\r\n   Mac. Being vnprepar'd,\r\nOur will became the seruant to defect,\r\nWhich else should free haue wrought\r\n\r\n   Banq. All's well.\r\nI dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:\r\nTo you they haue shew'd some truth\r\n\r\n   Macb. I thinke not of them:\r\nYet when we can entreat an houre to serue,\r\nWe would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,\r\nIf you would graunt the time\r\n\r\n   Banq. At your kind'st leysure\r\n\r\n   Macb. If you shall cleaue to my consent,\r\nWhen 'tis, it shall make Honor for you\r\n\r\n   Banq. So I lose none,\r\nIn seeking to augment it, but still keepe\r\nMy Bosome franchis'd, and Allegeance cleare,\r\nI shall be counsail'd\r\n\r\n   Macb. Good repose the while\r\n\r\n   Banq. Thankes Sir: the like to you.\r\n\r\nExit Banquo.\r\n\r\n  Macb. Goe bid thy Mistresse, when my drinke is ready,\r\nShe strike vpon the Bell. Get thee to bed.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\nIs this a Dagger, which I see before me,\r\nThe Handle toward my Hand? Come, let me clutch thee:\r\nI haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.\r\nArt thou not fatall Vision, sensible\r\nTo feeling, as to sight? or art thou but\r\nA Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,\r\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine?\r\nI see thee yet, in forme as palpable,\r\nAs this which now I draw.\r\nThou marshall'st me the way that I was going,\r\nAnd such an Instrument I was to vse.\r\nMine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other Sences,\r\nOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;\r\nAnd on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,\r\nWhich was not so before. There's no such thing:\r\nIt is the bloody Businesse, which informes\r\nThus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World\r\nNature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse\r\nThe Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates\r\nPale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,\r\nAlarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,\r\nWhose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\r\nWith Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe\r\nMoues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth\r\nHeare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare\r\nThy very stones prate of my where-about,\r\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\r\nWhich now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:\r\nWords to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.\r\n\r\nA Bell rings.\r\n\r\nI goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.\r\nHeare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,\r\nThat summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Secunda.\r\n\r\nEnter Lady.\r\n\r\n  La. That which hath made the[m] drunk, hath made me bold:\r\nWhat hath quench'd them, hath giuen me fire.\r\nHearke, peace: it was the Owle that shriek'd,\r\nThe fatall Bell-man, which giues the stern'st good-night.\r\nHe is about it, the Doores are open:\r\nAnd the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge\r\nWith Snores. I haue drugg'd their Possets,\r\nThat Death and Nature doe contend about them,\r\nWhether they liue, or dye.\r\nEnter Macbeth.\r\n\r\n  Macb. Who's there? what hoa?\r\n  Lady. Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,\r\nAnd 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,\r\nConfounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,\r\nHe could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled\r\nMy Father as he slept, I had don't.\r\nMy Husband?\r\n  Macb. I haue done the deed:\r\nDidst thou not heare a noyse?\r\n  Lady. I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets cry.\r\nDid not you speake?\r\n  Macb. When?\r\n  Lady. Now\r\n\r\n   Macb. As I descended?\r\n  Lady. I\r\n\r\n   Macb. Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?\r\n  Lady. Donalbaine\r\n\r\n   Mac. This is a sorry sight\r\n\r\n   Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight\r\n\r\n   Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,\r\nAnd one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:\r\nI stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,\r\nAnd addrest them againe to sleepe\r\n\r\n   Lady. There are two lodg'd together\r\n\r\n   Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,\r\nAs they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:\r\nListning their feare, I could not say Amen,\r\nWhen they did say God blesse vs\r\n\r\n   Lady. Consider it not so deepely\r\n\r\n   Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?\r\nI had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat\r\n\r\n   Lady. These deeds must not be thought\r\nAfter these wayes: so, it will make vs mad\r\n\r\n   Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:\r\nMacbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,\r\nSleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,\r\nThe death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,\r\nBalme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,\r\nChiefe nourisher in Life's Feast\r\n\r\n   Lady. What doe you meane?\r\n  Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:\r\nGlamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor\r\nShall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more\r\n\r\n   Lady. Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,\r\nYou doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke\r\nSo braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,\r\nAnd wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.\r\nWhy did you bring these Daggers from the place?\r\nThey must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare\r\nThe sleepie Groomes with blood\r\n\r\n   Macb. Ile goe no more:\r\nI am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:\r\nLooke on't againe, I dare not\r\n\r\n   Lady. Infirme of purpose:\r\nGiue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,\r\nAre but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,\r\nThat feares a painted Deuill. If he doe bleed,\r\nIle guild the Faces of the Groomes withall,\r\nFor it must seeme their Guilt.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\nKnocke within.\r\n\r\n  Macb. Whence is that knocking?\r\nHow is't with me, when euery noyse appalls me?\r\nWhat Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.\r\nWill all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood\r\nCleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather\r\nThe multitudinous Seas incarnardine,\r\nMaking the Greene one, Red.\r\nEnter Lady.\r\n\r\n  Lady. My Hands are of your colour: but I shame\r\nTo weare a Heart so white.\r\n\r\nKnocke.\r\n\r\nI heare a knocking at the South entry:\r\nRetyre we to our Chamber:\r\nA little Water cleares vs of this deed.\r\nHow easie is it then? your Constancie\r\nHath left you vnattended.\r\n\r\nKnocke.\r\n\r\nHearke, more knocking.\r\nGet on your Night-Gowne, least occasion call vs,\r\nAnd shew vs to be Watchers: be not lost\r\nSo poorely in your thoughts\r\n\r\n   Macb. To know my deed,\r\n\r\nKnocke.\r\n\r\n'Twere best not know my selfe.\r\nWake Duncan with thy knocking:\r\nI would thou could'st.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Tertia.\r\n\r\nEnter a Porter. Knocking within.\r\n\r\n  Porter. Here's a knocking indeede: if a man were\r\nPorter of Hell Gate, hee should haue old turning the\r\nKey.\r\n\r\nKnock.\r\n\r\nKnock, Knock, Knock. Who's there\r\ni'th' name of Belzebub? Here's a Farmer, that hang'd\r\nhimselfe on th' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue\r\nNapkins enow about you, here you'le sweat for't.\r\n\r\nKnock.\r\n\r\nKnock, knock. Who's there in th' other Deuils Name?\r\nFaith here's an Equiuocator, that could sweare in both\r\nthe Scales against eyther Scale, who committed Treason\r\nenough for Gods sake, yet could not equiuocate to Heauen:\r\noh come in, Equiuocator.\r\n\r\nKnock.\r\n\r\nKnock, Knock, Knock. Who's there? 'Faith here's an English\r\nTaylor come hither, for stealing out of a French Hose:\r\nCome in Taylor, here you may rost your Goose.\r\nKnock.\r\n\r\nKnock, Knock. Neuer at quiet: What are you? but this\r\nplace is too cold for Hell. Ile Deuill-Porter it no further:\r\nI had thought to haue let in some of all Professions, that\r\ngoe the Primrose way to th' euerlasting Bonfire.\r\n\r\nKnock.\r\n\r\nAnon, anon, I pray you remember the Porter.\r\nEnter Macduff, and Lenox.\r\n\r\n  Macd. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to Bed,\r\nThat you doe lye so late?\r\n  Port. Faith Sir, we were carowsing till the second Cock:\r\nAnd Drinke, Sir, is a great prouoker of three things\r\n\r\n   Macd. What three things does Drinke especially\r\nprouoke?\r\n  Port. Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.\r\nLecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes\r\nthe desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore\r\nmuch Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:\r\nit makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,\r\nand it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens\r\nhim; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,\r\nequiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,\r\nleaues him\r\n\r\n   Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night\r\n\r\n   Port. That it did, Sir, i'the very Throat on me: but I\r\nrequited him for his Lye, and (I thinke) being too strong\r\nfor him, though he tooke vp my Legges sometime, yet I\r\nmade a Shift to cast him.\r\nEnter Macbeth.\r\n\r\n  Macd. Is thy Master stirring?\r\nOur knocking ha's awak'd him: here he comes\r\n\r\n   Lenox. Good morrow, Noble Sir\r\n\r\n   Macb. Good morrow both\r\n\r\n   Macd. Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?\r\n  Macb. Not yet\r\n\r\n   Macd. He did command me to call timely on him,\r\nI haue almost slipt the houre\r\n\r\n   Macb. Ile bring you to him\r\n\r\n   Macd. I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you:\r\nBut yet 'tis one\r\n\r\n   Macb. The labour we delight in, Physicks paine:\r\nThis is the Doore\r\n\r\n   Macd. Ile make so bold to call, for 'tis my limitted\r\nseruice.\r\n\r\nExit Macduffe.\r\n\r\n  Lenox. Goes the King hence to day?\r\n  Macb. He does: he did appoint so\r\n\r\n   Lenox. The Night ha's been vnruly:\r\nWhere we lay, our Chimneys were blowne downe,\r\nAnd (as they say) lamentings heard i'th' Ayre;\r\nStrange Schreemes of Death,\r\nAnd Prophecying, with Accents terrible,\r\nOf dyre Combustion, and confus'd Euents,\r\nNew hatch'd toth' wofull time.\r\nThe obscure Bird clamor'd the liue-long Night.\r\nSome say, the Earth was Feuorous,\r\nAnd did shake\r\n\r\n   Macb. 'Twas a rough Night\r\n\r\n   Lenox. My young remembrance cannot paralell\r\nA fellow to it.\r\nEnter Macduff.\r\n\r\n  Macd. O horror, horror, horror,\r\nTongue nor Heart cannot conceiue, nor name thee\r\n\r\n   Macb. and Lenox. What's the matter?\r\n  Macd. Confusion now hath made his Master-peece:\r\nMost sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope\r\nThe Lords anoynted Temple, and stole thence\r\nThe Life o'th' Building\r\n\r\n   Macb. What is't you say, the Life?\r\n  Lenox. Meane you his Maiestie?\r\n  Macd. Approch the Chamber, and destroy your sight\r\nWith a new Gorgon. Doe not bid me speake:\r\nSee, and then speake your selues: awake, awake,\r\n\r\nExeunt. Macbeth and Lenox.\r\n\r\nRing the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,\r\nBanquo, and Donalbaine: Malcolme awake,\r\nShake off this Downey sleepe, Deaths counterfeit,\r\nAnd looke on Death it selfe: vp, vp, and see\r\nThe great Doomes Image: Malcolme, Banquo,\r\nAs from your Graues rise vp, and walke like Sprights,\r\nTo countenance this horror. Ring the Bell.\r\n\r\nBell rings. Enter Lady.\r\n\r\n  Lady. What's the Businesse?\r\nThat such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley\r\nThe sleepers of the House? speake, speake\r\n\r\n   Macd. O gentle Lady,\r\n'Tis not for you to heare what I can speake:\r\nThe repetition in a Womans eare,\r\nWould murther as it fell.\r\nEnter Banquo.\r\n\r\nO Banquo, Banquo, Our Royall Master's murther'd\r\n\r\n   Lady. Woe, alas:\r\nWhat, in our House?\r\n  Ban. Too cruell, any where.\r\nDeare Duff, I prythee contradict thy selfe,\r\nAnd say, it is not so.\r\nEnter Macbeth, Lenox, and Rosse.\r\n\r\n  Macb. Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,\r\nI had liu'd a blessed time: for from this instant,\r\nThere's nothing serious in Mortalitie:\r\nAll is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,\r\nThe Wine of Life is drawne, and the meere Lees\r\nIs left this Vault, to brag of.\r\nEnter Malcolme and Donalbaine.\r\n\r\n  Donal. What is amisse?\r\n  Macb. You are, and doe not know't:\r\nThe Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood\r\nIs stopt, the very Source of it is stopt\r\n\r\n   Macd. Your Royall Father's murther'd\r\n\r\n   Mal. Oh, by whom?\r\n  Lenox. Those of his Chamber, as it seem'd, had don't:\r\nTheir Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,\r\nSo were their Daggers, which vnwip'd, we found\r\nVpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,\r\nNo mans Life was to be trusted with them\r\n\r\n   Macb. O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,\r\nThat I did kill them\r\n\r\n   Macd. Wherefore did you so?\r\n  Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,\r\nLoyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:\r\nTh' expedition of my violent Loue\r\nOut-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,\r\nHis Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood,\r\nAnd his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,\r\nFor Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,\r\nSteep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers\r\nVnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine,\r\nThat had a heart to loue; and in that heart,\r\nCourage, to make's loue knowne?\r\n  Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa\r\n\r\n   Macd. Looke to the Lady\r\n\r\n   Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,\r\nThat most may clayme this argument for ours?\r\n  Donal. What should be spoken here,\r\nWhere our Fate hid in an augure hole,\r\nMay rush, and seize vs? Let's away,\r\nOur Teares are not yet brew'd\r\n\r\n   Mal. Nor our strong Sorrow\r\nVpon the foot of Motion\r\n\r\n   Banq. Looke to the Lady:\r\nAnd when we haue our naked Frailties hid,\r\nThat suffer in exposure; let vs meet,\r\nAnd question this most bloody piece of worke,\r\nTo know it further. Feares and scruples shake vs:\r\nIn the great Hand of God I stand, and thence,\r\nAgainst the vndivulg'd pretence, I fight\r\nOf Treasonous Mallice\r\n\r\n   Macd. And so doe I\r\n\r\n   All. So all\r\n\r\n   Macb. Let's briefely put on manly readinesse,\r\nAnd meet i'th' Hall together\r\n\r\n   All. Well contented.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n  Malc. What will you doe?\r\nLet's not consort with them:\r\nTo shew an vnfelt Sorrow, is an Office\r\nWhich the false man do's easie.\r\nIle to England\r\n\r\n   Don. To Ireland, I:\r\nOur seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer:\r\nWhere we are, there's Daggers in mens smiles;\r\nThe neere in blood, the neerer bloody\r\n\r\n   Malc. This murtherous Shaft that's shot,\r\nHath not yet lighted: and our safest way,\r\nIs to auoid the ayme. Therefore to Horse,\r\nAnd let vs not be daintie of leaue-taking,\r\nBut shift away: there's warrant in that Theft,\r\nWhich steales it selfe, when there's no mercie left.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Quarta.\r\n\r\nEnter Rosse, with an Old man.\r\n\r\n  Old man. Threescore and ten I can remember well,\r\nWithin the Volume of which Time, I haue seene\r\nHoures dreadfull, and things strange: but this sore Night\r\nHath trifled former knowings\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Ha, good Father,\r\nThou seest the Heauens, as troubled with mans Act,\r\nThreatens his bloody Stage: byth' Clock 'tis Day,\r\nAnd yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:\r\nIs't Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,\r\nThat Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe,\r\nWhen liuing Light should kisse it?\r\n  Old man. 'Tis vnnaturall,\r\nEuen like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,\r\nA Faulcon towring in her pride of place,\r\nWas by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd\r\n\r\n   Rosse. And Duncans Horses,\r\n(A thing most strange, and certaine)\r\nBeauteous, and swift, the Minions of their Race,\r\nTurn'd wilde in nature, broke their stalls, flong out,\r\nContending 'gainst Obedience, as they would\r\nMake Warre with Mankinde\r\n\r\n   Old man. 'Tis said, they eate each other\r\n\r\n   Rosse. They did so:\r\nTo th' amazement of mine eyes that look'd vpon't.\r\nEnter Macduffe.\r\n\r\nHeere comes the good Macduffe.\r\nHow goes the world Sir, now?\r\n  Macd. Why see you not?\r\n  Ross. Is't known who did this more then bloody deed?\r\n  Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine\r\n\r\n   Ross. Alas the day,\r\nWhat good could they pretend?\r\n  Macd. They were subborned,\r\nMalcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes\r\nAre stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them\r\nSuspition of the deed\r\n\r\n   Rosse. 'Gainst Nature still,\r\nThriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vp\r\nThine owne liues meanes: Then 'tis most like,\r\nThe Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth\r\n\r\n   Macd. He is already nam'd, and gone to Scone\r\nTo be inuested\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Where is Duncans body?\r\n  Macd. Carried to Colmekill,\r\nThe Sacred Store-house of his Predecessors,\r\nAnd Guardian of their Bones\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Will you to Scone?\r\n  Macd. No Cosin, Ile to Fife\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Well, I will thither\r\n\r\n   Macd. Well may you see things wel done there: Adieu\r\nLeast our old Robes sit easier then our new\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Farewell, Father\r\n\r\n   Old M. Gods benyson go with you, and with those\r\nThat would make good of bad, and Friends of Foes.\r\n\r\nExeunt. omnes\r\n\r\nActus Tertius. Scena Prima.\r\n\r\nEnter Banquo.\r\n\r\n  Banq. Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,\r\nAs the weyard Women promis'd, and I feare\r\nThou playd'st most fowly for't: yet it was saide\r\nIt should not stand in thy Posterity,\r\nBut that my selfe should be the Roote, and Father\r\nOf many Kings. If there come truth from them,\r\nAs vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,\r\nWhy by the verities on thee made good,\r\nMay they not be my Oracles as well,\r\nAnd set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.\r\n\r\nSenit sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox, Rosse, Lords,\r\nand\r\nAttendants.\r\n\r\n  Macb. Heere's our chiefe Guest\r\n\r\n   La. If he had beene forgotten,\r\nIt had bene as a gap in our great Feast,\r\nAnd all-thing vnbecomming\r\n\r\n   Macb. To night we hold a solemne Supper sir,\r\nAnd Ile request your presence\r\n\r\n   Banq. Let your Highnesse\r\nCommand vpon me, to the which my duties\r\nAre with a most indissoluble tye\r\nFor euer knit\r\n\r\n   Macb. Ride you this afternoone?\r\n  Ban. I, my good Lord\r\n\r\n   Macb. We should haue else desir'd your good aduice\r\n(Which still hath been both graue, and prosperous)\r\nIn this dayes Councell: but wee'le take to morrow.\r\nIs't farre you ride?\r\n  Ban. As farre, my Lord, as will fill vp the time\r\n'Twixt this, and Supper. Goe not my Horse the better,\r\nI must become a borrower of the Night,\r\nFor a darke houre, or twaine\r\n\r\n   Macb. Faile not our Feast\r\n\r\n   Ban. My Lord, I will not\r\n\r\n   Macb. We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow'd\r\nIn England, and in Ireland, not confessing\r\nTheir cruell Parricide, filling their hearers\r\nWith strange inuention. But of that to morrow,\r\nWhen therewithall, we shall haue cause of State,\r\nCrauing vs ioyntly. Hye you to Horse:\r\nAdieu, till you returne at Night.\r\nGoes Fleance with you?\r\n  Ban. I, my good Lord: our time does call vpon's\r\n\r\n   Macb. I wish your Horses swift, and sure of foot:\r\nAnd so I doe commend you to their backs.\r\nFarwell.\r\n\r\nExit Banquo.\r\n\r\nLet euery man be master of his time,\r\nTill seuen at Night, to make societie\r\nThe sweeter welcome:\r\nWe will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone:\r\nWhile then, God be with you.\r\n\r\nExeunt. Lords.\r\n\r\nSirrha, a word with you: Attend those men\r\nOur pleasure?\r\n  Seruant. They are, my Lord, without the Pallace\r\nGate\r\n\r\n   Macb. Bring them before vs.\r\n\r\nExit Seruant.\r\n\r\nTo be thus, is nothing, but to be safely thus\r\nOur feares in Banquo sticke deepe,\r\nAnd in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that\r\nWhich would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,\r\nAnd to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,\r\nHe hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,\r\nTo act in safetie. There is none but he,\r\nWhose being I doe feare: and vnder him,\r\nMy Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said\r\nMark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,\r\nWhen first they put the Name of King vpon me,\r\nAnd bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,\r\nThey hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.\r\nVpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,\r\nAnd put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,\r\nThence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,\r\nNo Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,\r\nFor Banquo's Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,\r\nFor them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,\r\nPut Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace\r\nOnely for them, and mine eternall Iewell\r\nGiuen to the common Enemie of Man,\r\nTo make them Kings, the Seedes of Banquo Kings.\r\nRather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,\r\nAnd champion me to th' vtterance.\r\nWho's there?\r\nEnter Seruant, and two Murtherers.\r\n\r\nNow goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.\r\n\r\nExit Seruant.\r\n\r\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\r\n  Murth. It was, so please your Highnesse\r\n\r\n   Macb. Well then,\r\nNow haue you consider'd of my speeches:\r\nKnow, that it was he, in the times past,\r\nWhich held you so vnder fortune,\r\nWhich you thought had been our innocent selfe.\r\nThis I made good to you, in our last conference,\r\nPast in probation with you:\r\nHow you were borne in hand, how crost:\r\nThe Instruments: who wrought with them:\r\nAnd all things else, that might\r\nTo halfe a Soule, and to a Notion craz'd,\r\nSay, Thus did Banquo\r\n\r\n   1.Murth. You made it knowne to vs\r\n\r\n   Macb. I did so:\r\nAnd went further, which is now\r\nOur point of second meeting.\r\nDoe you finde your patience so predominant,\r\nIn your nature, that you can let this goe?\r\nAre you so Gospell'd, to pray for this good man,\r\nAnd for his Issue, whose heauie hand\r\nHath bow'd you to the Graue, and begger'd\r\nYours for euer?\r\n  1.Murth. We are men, my Liege\r\n\r\n   Macb. I, in the Catalogue ye goe for men,\r\nAs Hounds, and Greyhounds, Mungrels, Spaniels, Curres,\r\nShowghes, Water-Rugs, and Demy-Wolues are clipt\r\nAll by the Name of Dogges: the valued file\r\nDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\r\nThe House-keeper, the Hunter, euery one\r\nAccording to the gift, which bounteous Nature\r\nHath in him clos'd: whereby he does receiue\r\nParticular addition, from the Bill,\r\nThat writes them all alike: and so of men.\r\nNow, if you haue a station in the file,\r\nNot i'th' worst ranke of Manhood, say't,\r\nAnd I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes,\r\nWhose execution takes your Enemie off,\r\nGrapples you to the heart; and loue of vs,\r\nWho weare our Health but sickly in his Life,\r\nWhich in his Death were perfect\r\n\r\n   2.Murth. I am one, my Liege,\r\nWhom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World\r\nHath so incens'd, that I am recklesse what I doe,\r\nTo spight the World\r\n\r\n   1.Murth. And I another,\r\nSo wearie with Disasters, tugg'd with Fortune,\r\nThat I would set my Life on any Chance,\r\nTo mend it, or be rid on't\r\n\r\n   Macb. Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie\r\n\r\n   Murth. True, my Lord\r\n\r\n   Macb. So is he mine: and in such bloody distance,\r\nThat euery minute of his being, thrusts\r\nAgainst my neer'st of Life: and though I could\r\nWith bare-fac'd power sweepe him from my sight,\r\nAnd bid my will auouch it; yet I must not,\r\nFor certaine friends that are both his, and mine,\r\nWhose loues I may not drop, but wayle his fall,\r\nWho I my selfe struck downe: and thence it is,\r\nThat I to your assistance doe make loue,\r\nMasking the Businesse from the common Eye,\r\nFor sundry weightie Reasons\r\n\r\n   2.Murth. We shall, my Lord,\r\nPerforme what you command vs\r\n\r\n   1.Murth. Though our Liues-\r\n  Macb. Your Spirits shine through you.\r\nWithin this houre, at most,\r\nI will aduise you where to plant your selues,\r\nAcquaint you with the perfect Spy o'th' time,\r\nThe moment on't, for't must be done to Night,\r\nAnd something from the Pallace: alwayes thought,\r\nThat I require a clearenesse; and with him,\r\nTo leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke:\r\n  Fleans , his Sonne, that keepes him companie,\r\nWhose absence is no lesse materiall to me,\r\nThen is his Fathers, must embrace the fate\r\nOf that darke houre: resolue your selues apart,\r\nIle come to you anon\r\n\r\n   Murth. We are resolu'd, my Lord\r\n\r\n   Macb. Ile call vpon you straight: abide within,\r\nIt is concluded: Banquo, thy Soules flight,\r\nIf it finde Heauen, must finde it out to Night.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Secunda.\r\n\r\nEnter Macbeths Lady, and a Seruant.\r\n\r\n  Lady. Is Banquo gone from Court?\r\n  Seruant. I, Madame, but returnes againe to Night\r\n\r\n   Lady. Say to the King, I would attend his leysure,\r\nFor a few words\r\n\r\n   Seruant. Madame, I will.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Lady. Nought's had, all's spent.\r\nWhere our desire is got without content:\r\n'Tis safer, to be that which we destroy,\r\nThen by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy.\r\nEnter Macbeth.\r\n\r\nHow now, my Lord, why doe you keepe alone?\r\nOf sorryest Fancies your Companions making,\r\nVsing those Thoughts, which should indeed haue dy'd\r\nWith them they thinke on: things without all remedie\r\nShould be without regard: what's done, is done\r\n\r\n   Macb. We haue scorch'd the Snake, not kill'd it:\r\nShee'le close, and be her selfe, whilest our poore Mallice\r\nRemaines in danger of her former Tooth.\r\nBut let the frame of things dis-ioynt,\r\nBoth the Worlds suffer,\r\nEre we will eate our Meale in feare, and sleepe\r\nIn the affliction of these terrible Dreames,\r\nThat shake vs Nightly: Better be with the dead,\r\nWhom we, to gayne our peace, haue sent to peace,\r\nThen on the torture of the Minde to lye\r\nIn restlesse extasie.\r\nDuncane is in his Graue:\r\nAfter Lifes fitfull Feuer, he sleepes well,\r\nTreason ha's done his worst: nor Steele, nor Poyson,\r\nMallice domestique, forraine Leuie, nothing,\r\nCan touch him further\r\n\r\n   Lady. Come on:\r\nGentle my Lord, sleeke o're your rugged Lookes,\r\nBe bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night\r\n\r\n   Macb. So shall I Loue, and so I pray be you:\r\nLet your remembrance apply to Banquo,\r\nPresent him Eminence, both with Eye and Tongue:\r\nVnsafe the while, that wee must laue\r\nOur Honors in these flattering streames,\r\nAnd make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts,\r\nDisguising what they are\r\n\r\n   Lady. You must leaue this\r\n\r\n   Macb. O, full of Scorpions is my Minde, deare Wife:\r\nThou know'st, that Banquo and his Fleans liues\r\n\r\n   Lady. But in them, Natures Coppie's not eterne\r\n\r\n   Macb. There's comfort yet, they are assaileable,\r\nThen be thou iocund: ere the Bat hath flowne\r\nHis Cloyster'd flight, ere to black Heccats summons\r\nThe shard-borne Beetle, with his drowsie hums,\r\nHath rung Nights yawning Peale,\r\nThere shall be done a deed of dreadfull note\r\n\r\n   Lady. What's to be done?\r\n  Macb. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest Chuck,\r\nTill thou applaud the deed: Come, seeling Night,\r\nSkarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day,\r\nAnd with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand\r\nCancell and teare to pieces that great Bond,\r\nWhich keepes me pale. Light thickens,\r\nAnd the Crow makes Wing toth' Rookie Wood:\r\nGood things of Day begin to droope, and drowse,\r\nWhiles Nights black Agents to their Prey's doe rowse.\r\nThou maruell'st at my words: but hold thee still,\r\nThings bad begun, make strong themselues by ill:\r\nSo prythee goe with me.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Tertia.\r\n\r\nEnter three Murtherers.\r\n\r\n  1. But who did bid thee ioyne with vs?\r\n  3. Macbeth\r\n\r\n   2. He needes not our mistrust, since he deliuers\r\nOur Offices, and what we haue to doe,\r\nTo the direction iust\r\n\r\n   1. Then stand with vs:\r\nThe West yet glimmers with some streakes of Day.\r\nNow spurres the lated Traueller apace,\r\nTo gayne the timely Inne, and neere approches\r\nThe subiect of our Watch\r\n\r\n   3. Hearke, I heare Horses\r\n\r\n   Banquo within. Giue vs a Light there, hoa\r\n\r\n   2. Then 'tis hee:\r\nThe rest, that are within the note of expectation,\r\nAlreadie are i'th' Court\r\n\r\n   1.

O, Trecherie!\r\nFlye good Fleans, flye, flye, flye,\r\nThou may'st reuenge. O Slaue!\r\n  3. Who did strike out the Light?\r\n  1. Was't not the way?\r\n  3. There's but one downe: the Sonne is fled\r\n\r\n   2. We haue lost\r\nBest halfe of our Affaire\r\n\r\n   1. Well, let's away, and say how much is done.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScaena Quarta.\r\n\r\nBanquet prepar'd. Enter Macbeth, Lady, Rosse, Lenox, Lords, and\r\nAttendants.\r\n\r\n  Macb.

Our selfe will mingle with Society,\r\nAnd play the humble Host:\r\nOur Hostesse keepes her State, but in best time\r\nWe will require her welcome\r\n\r\n   La. Pronounce it for me Sir, to all our Friends,\r\nFor my heart speakes, they are welcome.\r\nEnter first Murtherer.\r\n\r\n  Macb. See they encounter thee with their harts thanks\r\nBoth sides are euen: heere Ile sit i'th' mid'st,\r\nBe large in mirth, anon wee'l drinke a Measure\r\nThe Table round. There's blood vpon thy face\r\n\r\n   Mur. 'Tis Banquo's then\r\n\r\n   Macb. 'Tis better thee without, then he within.\r\nIs he dispatch'd?\r\n  Mur. My Lord his throat is cut, that I did for him\r\n\r\n   Mac. Thou art the best o'th' Cut-throats,\r\nYet hee's good that did the like for Fleans:\r\nIf thou did'st it, thou art the Non-pareill\r\n\r\n   Mur. Most Royall Sir\r\nFleans is scap'd\r\n\r\n   Macb. Then comes my Fit againe:\r\nI had else beene perfect;\r\nWhole as the Marble, founded as the Rocke,\r\nAs broad, and generall, as the casing Ayre:\r\nBut now I am cabin'd, crib'd, confin'd, bound in\r\nTo sawcy doubts, and feares. But Banquo's safe?\r\n  Mur. I, my good Lord: safe in a ditch he bides,\r\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;\r\nThe least a Death to Nature\r\n\r\n   Macb. Thankes for that:\r\nThere the growne Serpent lyes, the worme that's fled\r\nHath Nature that in time will Venom breed,\r\nNo teeth for th' present. Get thee gone, to morrow\r\nWee'l heare our selues againe.\r\n\r\nExit Murderer.\r\n\r\n  Lady. My Royall Lord,\r\nYou do not giue the Cheere, the Feast is sold\r\nThat is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a making:\r\n'Tis giuen, with welcome: to feede were best at home:\r\nFrom thence, the sawce to meate is Ceremony,\r\nMeeting were bare without it.\r\nEnter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeths place.\r\n\r\n  Macb.

Here had we now our Countries Honor, roof'd,\r\nWere the grac'd person of our Banquo present:\r\nWho, may I rather challenge for vnkindnesse,\r\nThen pitty for Mischance\r\n\r\n   Rosse. His absence (Sir)\r\nLayes blame vpon his promise. Pleas't your Highnesse\r\nTo grace vs with your Royall Company?\r\n  Macb. The Table's full\r\n\r\n   Lenox. Heere is a place reseru'd Sir\r\n\r\n   Macb. Where?\r\n  Lenox. Heere my good Lord.\r\nWhat is't that moues your Highnesse?\r\n  Macb. Which of you haue done this?\r\n  Lords. What, my good Lord?\r\n  Macb. Thou canst not say I did it: neuer shake\r\nThy goary lockes at me\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Gentlemen rise, his Highnesse is not well\r\n\r\n   Lady. Sit worthy Friends: my Lord is often thus,\r\nAnd hath beene from his youth. Pray you keepe Seat,\r\nThe fit is momentary, vpon a thought\r\nHe will againe be well. If much you note him\r\nYou shall offend him, and extend his Passion,\r\nFeed, and regard him not. Are you a man?\r\n  Macb. I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that\r\nWhich might appall the Diuell\r\n\r\n   La. O proper stuffe:\r\nThis is the very painting of your feare:\r\nThis is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said\r\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flawes and starts\r\n(Impostors to true feare) would well become\r\nA womans story, at a Winters fire\r\nAuthoriz'd by her Grandam: shame it selfe,\r\nWhy do you make such faces? When all's done\r\nYou looke but on a stoole\r\n\r\n   Macb. Prythee see there:\r\nBehold, looke, loe, how say you:\r\nWhy what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too.\r\nIf Charnell houses, and our Graues must send\r\nThose that we bury, backe; our Monuments\r\nShall be the Mawes of Kytes\r\n\r\n   La. What? quite vnmann'd in folly\r\n\r\n   Macb. If I stand heere, I saw him\r\n\r\n   La. Fie for shame\r\n\r\n   Macb. Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time\r\nEre humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale:\r\nI, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd\r\nToo terrible for the eare. The times has bene,\r\nThat when the Braines were out, the man would dye,\r\nAnd there an end: But now they rise againe\r\nWith twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,\r\nAnd push vs from our stooles. This is more strange\r\nThen such a murther is\r\n\r\n   La. My worthy Lord\r\nYour Noble Friends do lacke you\r\n\r\n   Macb. I do forget:\r\nDo not muse at me my most worthy Friends,\r\nI haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing\r\nTo those that know me. Come, loue and health to all,\r\nThen Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full:\r\nEnter Ghost.\r\n\r\nI drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,\r\nAnd to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse:\r\nWould he were heere: to all, and him we thirst,\r\nAnd all to all\r\n\r\n   Lords. Our duties, and the pledge\r\n\r\n   Mac. Auant, & quit my sight, let the earth hide thee:\r\nThy bones are marrowlesse, thy blood is cold:\r\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes\r\nWhich thou dost glare with\r\n\r\n   La. Thinke of this good Peeres\r\nBut as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other,\r\nOnely it spoyles the pleasure of the time\r\n\r\n   Macb. What man dare, I dare:\r\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,\r\nThe arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,\r\nTake any shape but that, and my firme Nerues\r\nShall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,\r\nAnd dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:\r\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest mee\r\nThe Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,\r\nVnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone\r\nI am a man againe: pray you sit still\r\n\r\n   La. You haue displac'd the mirth,\r\nBroke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder\r\n\r\n   Macb. Can such things be,\r\nAnd ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,\r\nWithout our speciall wonder? You make me strange\r\nEuen to the disposition that I owe,\r\nWhen now I thinke you can behold such sights,\r\nAnd keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,\r\nWhen mine is blanch'd with feare\r\n\r\n   Rosse. What sights, my Lord?\r\n  La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse\r\nQuestion enrages him: at once, goodnight.\r\nStand not vpon the order of your going,\r\nBut go at once\r\n\r\n   Len. Good night, and better health\r\nAttend his Maiesty\r\n\r\n   La. A kinde goodnight to all.\r\n\r\nExit Lords.\r\n\r\n  Macb. It will haue blood they say:\r\nBlood will haue Blood:\r\nStones haue beene knowne to moue, & Trees to speake:\r\nAugures, and vnderstood Relations, haue\r\nBy Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth\r\nThe secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?\r\n  La. Almost at oddes with morning, which is which\r\n\r\n   Macb. How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person\r\nAt our great bidding\r\n\r\n   La. Did you send to him Sir?\r\n  Macb. I heare it by the way: But I will send:\r\nThere's not a one of them but in his house\r\nI keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow\r\n(And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters.\r\nMore shall they speake: for now I am bent to know\r\nBy the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good,\r\nAll causes shall giue way. I am in blood\r\nStept in so farre, that should I wade no more,\r\nReturning were as tedious as go ore:\r\nStrange things I haue in head, that will to hand,\r\nWhich must be acted, ere they may be scand\r\n\r\n   La. You lacke the season of all Natures, sleepe\r\n\r\n   Macb. Come, wee'l to sleepe: My strange & self-abuse\r\nIs the initiate feare, that wants hard vse:\r\nWe are yet but yong indeed.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Quinta.\r\n\r\nThunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecat.\r\n\r\n  1. Why how now Hecat, you looke angerly?\r\n  Hec. Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?\r\nSawcy, and ouer-bold, how did you dare\r\nTo Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth,\r\nIn Riddles, and Affaires of death;\r\nAnd I the Mistris of your Charmes,\r\nThe close contriuer of all harmes,\r\nWas neuer call'd to beare my part,\r\nOr shew the glory of our Art?\r\nAnd which is worse, all you haue done\r\nHath bene but for a wayward Sonne,\r\nSpightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do)\r\nLoues for his owne ends, not for you.\r\nBut make amends now: Get you gon,\r\nAnd at the pit of Acheron\r\nMeete me i'th' Morning: thither he\r\nWill come, to know his Destinie.\r\nYour Vessels, and your Spels prouide,\r\nYour Charmes, and euery thing beside;\r\nI am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend\r\nVnto a dismall, and a Fatall end.\r\nGreat businesse must be wrought ere Noone.\r\nVpon the Corner of the Moone\r\nThere hangs a vap'rous drop, profound,\r\nIle catch it ere it come to ground;\r\nAnd that distill'd by Magicke slights,\r\nShall raise such Artificiall Sprights,\r\nAs by the strength of their illusion,\r\nShall draw him on to his Confusion.\r\nHe shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare\r\nHis hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare:\r\nAnd you all know, Security\r\nIs Mortals cheefest Enemie.\r\n\r\nMusicke, and a Song.\r\n\r\nHearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see\r\nSits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me.\r\n\r\nSing within. Come away, come away, &c.\r\n\r\n  1 Come, let's make hast, shee'l soone be\r\nBacke againe.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScaena Sexta.\r\n\r\nEnter Lenox, and another Lord.\r\n\r\n  Lenox. My former Speeches,\r\nHaue but hit your Thoughts\r\nWhich can interpret farther: Onely I say\r\nThings haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\r\nWas pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:\r\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,\r\nWhom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,\r\nFor Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.\r\nWho cannot want the thought, how monstrous\r\nIt was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane\r\nTo kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,\r\nHow it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight\r\nIn pious rage, the two delinquents teare,\r\nThat were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?\r\nWas not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:\r\nFor 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue\r\nTo heare the men deny't. So that I say,\r\nHe ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,\r\nThat had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,\r\n(As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde\r\nWhat 'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.\r\nBut peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd\r\nHis presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare\r\nMacduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\r\nWhere he bestowes himselfe?\r\n  Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane\r\n(From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)\r\nLiues in the English Court, and is receyu'd\r\nOf the most Pious Edward, with such grace,\r\nThat the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing\r\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe\r\nIs gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd\r\nTo wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,\r\nThat by the helpe of these (with him aboue)\r\nTo ratifie the Worke) we may againe\r\nGiue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:\r\nFree from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;\r\nDo faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,\r\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\r\nHath so exasperate their King, that hee\r\nPrepares for some attempt of Warre\r\n\r\n   Len. Sent he to Macduffe?\r\n  Lord. He did: and with an absolute Sir, not I\r\nThe clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,\r\nAnd hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time\r\nThat clogges me with this Answer\r\n\r\n   Lenox. And that well might\r\nAduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance\r\nHis wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell\r\nFlye to the Court of England, and vnfold\r\nHis Message ere he come, that a swift blessing\r\nMay soone returne to this our suffering Country,\r\nVnder a hand accurs'd\r\n\r\n   Lord. Ile send my Prayers with him.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nActus Quartus. Scena Prima.\r\n\r\nThunder. Enter the three Witches.\r\n\r\n  1 Thrice the brinded Cat hath mew'd\r\n\r\n   2 Thrice, and once the Hedge-Pigge whin'd\r\n\r\n   3 Harpier cries, 'tis time, 'tis time\r\n\r\n   1 Round about the Caldron go:\r\nIn the poysond Entrailes throw\r\nToad, that vnder cold stone,\r\nDayes and Nights, ha's thirty one:\r\nSweltred Venom sleeping got,\r\nBoyle thou first i'th' charmed pot\r\n\r\n   All. Double, double, toile and trouble;\r\nFire burne, and Cauldron bubble\r\n\r\n   2 Fillet of a Fenny Snake,\r\nIn the Cauldron boyle and bake:\r\nEye of Newt, and Toe of Frogge,\r\nWooll of Bat, and Tongue of Dogge:\r\nAdders Forke, and Blinde-wormes Sting,\r\nLizards legge, and Howlets wing:\r\nFor a Charme of powrefull trouble,\r\nLike a Hell-broth, boyle and bubble\r\n\r\n   All. Double, double, toyle and trouble,\r\nFire burne, and Cauldron bubble\r\n\r\n   3 Scale of Dragon, Tooth of Wolfe,\r\nWitches Mummey, Maw, and Gulfe\r\nOf the rauin'd salt Sea sharke:\r\nRoote of Hemlocke, digg'd i'th' darke:\r\nLiuer of Blaspheming Iew,\r\nGall of Goate, and Slippes of Yew,\r\nSliuer'd in the Moones Ecclipse:\r\nNose of Turke, and Tartars lips:\r\nFinger of Birth-strangled Babe,\r\nDitch-deliuer'd by a Drab,\r\nMake the Grewell thicke, and slab.\r\nAdde thereto a Tigers Chawdron,\r\nFor th' Ingredience of our Cawdron\r\n\r\n   All. Double, double, toyle and trouble,\r\nFire burne, and Cauldron bubble\r\n\r\n   2 Coole it with a Baboones blood,\r\nThen the Charme is firme and good.\r\nEnter Hecat, and the other three Witches.\r\n\r\n  Hec. O well done: I commend your paines,\r\nAnd euery one shall share i'th' gaines:\r\nAnd now about the Cauldron sing\r\nLike Elues and Fairies in a Ring,\r\nInchanting all that you put in.\r\n\r\nMusicke and a Song. Blacke Spirits, &c.\r\n\r\n  2 By the pricking of my Thumbes,\r\nSomething wicked this way comes:\r\nOpen Lockes, who euer knockes.\r\nEnter Macbeth.\r\n\r\n  Macb. How now you secret, black, & midnight Hags?\r\nWhat is't you do?\r\n  All. A deed without a name\r\n\r\n   Macb. I coniure you, by that which you Professe,\r\n(How ere you come to know it) answer me:\r\nThough you vntye the Windes, and let them fight\r\nAgainst the Churches: Though the yesty Waues\r\nConfound and swallow Nauigation vp:\r\nThough bladed Corne be lodg'd, & Trees blown downe,\r\nThough Castles topple on their Warders heads:\r\nThough Pallaces, and Pyramids do slope\r\nTheir heads to their Foundations: Though the treasure\r\nOf Natures Germaine, tumble altogether,\r\nEuen till destruction sicken: Answer me\r\nTo what I aske you\r\n\r\n   1 Speake\r\n\r\n   2 Demand\r\n\r\n   3 Wee'l answer\r\n\r\n   1 Say, if th'hadst rather heare it from our mouthes,\r\nOr from our Masters\r\n\r\n   Macb. Call 'em: let me see 'em\r\n\r\n   1 Powre in Sowes blood, that hath eaten\r\nHer nine Farrow: Greaze that's sweaten\r\nFrom the Murderers Gibbet, throw\r\nInto the Flame\r\n\r\n   All. Come high or low:\r\nThy Selfe and Office deaftly show.\r\nThunder. 1. Apparation, an Armed Head.\r\n\r\n  Macb. Tell me, thou vnknowne power\r\n\r\n   1 He knowes thy thought:\r\nHeare his speech, but say thou nought\r\n\r\n   1 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth:\r\nBeware Macduffe,\r\nBeware the Thane of Fife: dismisse me. Enough.\r\n\r\nHe Descends.\r\n\r\n  Macb. What ere thou art, for thy good caution, thanks\r\nThou hast harp'd my feare aright. But one word more\r\n\r\n   1 He will not be commanded: heere's another\r\nMore potent then the first.\r\n\r\nThunder. 2 Apparition, a Bloody Childe.\r\n\r\n  2 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth\r\n\r\n   Macb. Had I three eares, Il'd heare thee\r\n\r\n   Appar. Be bloody, bold, & resolute:\r\nLaugh to scorne\r\nThe powre of man: For none of woman borne\r\nShall harme Macbeth.\r\n\r\nDescends.\r\n\r\n  Mac. Then liue Macduffe: what need I feare of thee?\r\nBut yet Ile make assurance: double sure,\r\nAnd take a Bond of Fate: thou shalt not liue,\r\nThat I may tell pale-hearted Feare, it lies;\r\nAnd sleepe in spight of Thunder.\r\n\r\nThunder 3 Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand.\r\n\r\nWhat is this, that rises like the issue of a King,\r\nAnd weares vpon his Baby-brow, the round\r\nAnd top of Soueraignty?\r\n  All. Listen, but speake not too't\r\n\r\n   3 Appar. Be Lyon metled, proud, and take no care:\r\nWho chafes, who frets, or where Conspirers are:\r\nMacbeth shall neuer vanquish'd be, vntill\r\nGreat Byrnam Wood, to high Dunsmane Hill\r\nShall come against him.\r\n\r\nDescend.\r\n\r\n  Macb. That will neuer bee:\r\nWho can impresse the Forrest, bid the Tree\r\nVnfixe his earth-bound Root? Sweet boadments, good:\r\nRebellious dead, rise neuer till the Wood\r\nOf Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd Macbeth\r\nShall liue the Lease of Nature, pay his breath\r\nTo time, and mortall Custome. Yet my Hart\r\nThrobs to know one thing: Tell me, if your Art\r\nCan tell so much: Shall Banquo's issue euer\r\nReigne in this Kingdome?\r\n  All. Seeke to know no more\r\n\r\n   Macb. I will be satisfied. Deny me this,\r\nAnd an eternall Curse fall on you: Let me know.\r\nWhy sinkes that Caldron? & what noise is this?\r\n\r\nHoboyes\r\n\r\n  1 Shew\r\n\r\n   2 Shew\r\n\r\n   3 Shew\r\n\r\n   All. Shew his Eyes, and greeue his Hart,\r\nCome like shadowes, so depart.\r\n\r\nA shew of eight Kings, and Banquo last, with a glasse in his hand.\r\n\r\n  Macb. Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:\r\nThy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire\r\nThou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:\r\nA third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,\r\nWhy do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!\r\nWhat will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?\r\nAnother yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:\r\nAnd yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,\r\nWhich shewes me many more: and some I see,\r\nThat two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.\r\nHorrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,\r\nFor the Blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles vpon me,\r\nAnd points at them for his. What? is this so?\r\n  1 I Sir, all this is so. But why\r\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly?\r\nCome Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,\r\nAnd shew the best of our delights.\r\nIle Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,\r\nWhile you performe your Antique round:\r\nThat this great King may kindly say,\r\nOur duties, did his welcome pay.\r\n\r\nMusicke. The Witches Dance, and vanish.\r\n\r\n  Macb. Where are they? Gone?\r\nLet this pernitious houre,\r\nStand aye accursed in the Kalender.\r\nCome in, without there.\r\nEnter Lenox.\r\n\r\n  Lenox. What's your Graces will\r\n\r\n   Macb. Saw you the Weyard Sisters?\r\n  Lenox. No my Lord\r\n\r\n   Macb. Came they not by you?\r\n  Lenox. No indeed my Lord\r\n\r\n   Macb. Infected be the Ayre whereon they ride,\r\nAnd damn'd all those that trust them. I did heare\r\nThe gallopping of Horse. Who was't came by?\r\n  Len. 'Tis two or three my Lord, that bring you word:\r\nMacduff is fled to England\r\n\r\n   Macb. Fled to England?\r\n  Len. I, my good Lord\r\n\r\n   Macb. Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits:\r\nThe flighty purpose neuer is o're-tooke\r\nVnlesse the deed go with it. From this moment,\r\nThe very firstlings of my heart shall be\r\nThe firstlings of my hand. And euen now\r\nTo Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:\r\nThe Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.\r\nSeize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword\r\nHis Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules\r\nThat trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,\r\nThis deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,\r\nBut no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?\r\nCome bring me where they are.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nScena Secunda.\r\n\r\nEnter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.\r\n\r\n  Wife. What had he done, to make him fly the Land?\r\n  Rosse. You must haue patience Madam\r\n\r\n   Wife. He had none:\r\nHis flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,\r\nOur feares do make vs Traitors\r\n\r\n   Rosse. You know not\r\nWhether it was his wisedome, or his feare\r\n\r\n   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,\r\nHis Mansion, and his Titles, in a place\r\nFrom whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,\r\nHe wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren\r\n(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,\r\nHer yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:\r\nAll is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;\r\nAs little is the Wisedome, where the flight\r\nSo runnes against all reason\r\n\r\n   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,\r\nI pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,\r\nHe is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes\r\nThe fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,\r\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\r\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\r\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\r\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\r\nEach way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:\r\nShall not be long but Ile be heere againe:\r\nThings at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,\r\nTo what they were before. My pretty Cosine,\r\nBlessing vpon you\r\n\r\n   Wife. Father'd he is,\r\nAnd yet hee's Father-lesse\r\n\r\n   Rosse. I am so much a Foole, should I stay longer\r\nIt would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.\r\nI take my leaue at once.\r\n\r\nExit Rosse.\r\n\r\n  Wife. Sirra, your Fathers dead,\r\nAnd what will you do now? How will you liue?\r\n  Son. As Birds do Mother\r\n\r\n   Wife. What with Wormes, and Flyes?\r\n  Son. With what I get I meane, and so do they\r\n\r\n   Wife. Poore Bird,\r\nThou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,\r\nThe Pitfall, nor the Gin\r\n\r\n   Son. Why should I Mother?\r\nPoore Birds they are not set for:\r\nMy Father is not dead for all your saying\r\n\r\n   Wife. Yes, he is dead:\r\nHow wilt thou do for a Father?\r\n  Son. Nay how will you do for a Husband?\r\n  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market\r\n\r\n   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe\r\n\r\n   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,\r\nAnd yet I'faith with wit enough for thee\r\n\r\n   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?\r\n  Wife. I, that he was\r\n\r\n   Son. What is a Traitor?\r\n  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes\r\n\r\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\r\n\r\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\r\nAnd must be hang'd\r\n\r\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\r\n  Wife. Euery one\r\n\r\n   Son. Who must hang them?\r\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\r\n\r\n   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there\r\nare Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,\r\nand hang vp them\r\n\r\n   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:\r\nBut how wilt thou do for a Father?\r\n  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you\r\nwould not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely\r\nhaue a new Father\r\n\r\n   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\n  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,\r\nThough in your state of Honor I am perfect;\r\nI doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.\r\nIf you will take a homely mans aduice,\r\nBe not found heere: Hence with your little ones\r\nTo fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:\r\nTo do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,\r\nWhich is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,\r\nI dare abide no longer.\r\n\r\nExit Messenger\r\n\r\n  Wife. Whether should I flye?\r\nI haue done no harme. But I remember now\r\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\r\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\r\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)\r\nDo I put vp that womanly defence,\r\nTo say I haue done no harme?\r\nWhat are these faces?\r\nEnter Murtherers.\r\n\r\n  Mur. Where is your Husband?\r\n  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,\r\nWhere such as thou may'st finde him\r\n\r\n   Mur. He's a Traitor\r\n\r\n   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine\r\n\r\n   Mur. What you Egge?\r\nYong fry of Treachery?\r\n  Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,\r\nRun away I pray you.\r\n\r\nExit crying Murther.\r\n\r\n\r\nScaena Tertia.\r\n\r\nEnter Malcolme and Macduffe.\r\n\r\n  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there\r\nWeepe our sad bosomes empty\r\n\r\n   Macd. Let vs rather\r\nHold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,\r\nBestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,\r\nNew Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes\r\nStrike heauen on the face, that it resounds\r\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out\r\nLike Syllable of Dolour\r\n\r\n   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;\r\nWhat know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,\r\nAs I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.\r\nWhat you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.\r\nThis Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\r\nWas once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,\r\nHe hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something\r\nYou may discerne of him through me, and wisedome\r\nTo offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe\r\nT' appease an angry God\r\n\r\n   Macd. I am not treacherous\r\n\r\n   Malc. But Macbeth is.\r\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\r\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\r\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\r\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\r\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\r\nYet Grace must still looke so\r\n\r\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\r\n\r\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\r\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\r\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\r\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\r\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\r\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\r\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\r\nWhat euer I shall thinke\r\n\r\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\r\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\r\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\r\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\r\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\r\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\r\nAnd the rich East to boot\r\n\r\n   Mal. Be not offended:\r\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\r\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\r\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\r\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\r\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\r\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\r\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\r\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\r\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\r\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\r\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\r\nBy him that shall succeede\r\n\r\n   Macd. What should he be?\r\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\r\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\r\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\r\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\r\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\r\nWith my confinelesse harmes\r\n\r\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\r\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\r\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\r\n\r\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\r\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\r\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\r\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\r\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\r\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\r\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\r\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\r\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\r\nThen such an one to reigne\r\n\r\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\r\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\r\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\r\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\r\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\r\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\r\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\r\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\r\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\r\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\r\nFinding it so inclinde\r\n\r\n   Mal. With this, there growes\r\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\r\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\r\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\r\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\r\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\r\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\r\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\r\nDestroying them for wealth\r\n\r\n   Macd. This Auarice\r\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\r\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\r\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\r\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\r\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\r\nWith other Graces weigh'd\r\n\r\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\r\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\r\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\r\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\r\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\r\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\r\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\r\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\r\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\r\nAll vnity on earth\r\n\r\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\r\n\r\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\r\nI am as I haue spoken\r\n\r\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\r\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\r\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\r\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\r\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\r\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\r\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\r\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\r\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\r\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\r\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\r\nThy hope ends heere\r\n\r\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\r\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\r\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\r\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\r\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\r\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\r\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\r\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\r\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\r\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\r\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\r\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\r\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\r\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\r\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\r\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\r\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\r\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\r\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\r\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\r\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\r\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\r\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\r\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\r\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\r\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\r\nEnter a Doctor.\r\n\r\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\r\nI pray you?\r\n  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules\r\nThat stay his Cure: their malady conuinces\r\nThe great assay of Art. But at his touch,\r\nSuch sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,\r\nThey presently amend.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Mal. I thanke you Doctor\r\n\r\n   Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?\r\n  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.\r\nA most myraculous worke in this good King,\r\nWhich often since my heere remaine in England,\r\nI haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen\r\nHimselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people\r\nAll swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,\r\nThe meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,\r\nHanging a golden stampe about their neckes,\r\nPut on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken\r\nTo the succeeding Royalty he leaues\r\nThe healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,\r\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\r\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\r\nThat speake him full of Grace.\r\nEnter Rosse.\r\n\r\n  Macd. See who comes heere\r\n\r\n   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not\r\n\r\n   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither\r\n\r\n   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue\r\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\r\n\r\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\r\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\r\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\r\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\r\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\r\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\r\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\r\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\r\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\r\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\r\nDying, or ere they sicken\r\n\r\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\r\n\r\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\r\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\r\nEach minute teemes a new one\r\n\r\n   Macd. How do's my Wife?\r\n  Rosse. Why well\r\n\r\n   Macd. And all my Children?\r\n  Rosse. Well too\r\n\r\n   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?\r\n  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em\r\n  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?\r\n  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings\r\nWhich I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour\r\nOf many worthy Fellowes, that were out,\r\nWhich was to my beleefe witnest the rather,\r\nFor that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.\r\nNow is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland\r\nWould create Soldiours, make our women fight,\r\nTo doffe their dire distresses\r\n\r\n   Malc. Bee't their comfort\r\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\r\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\r\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\r\nThat Christendome giues out\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\r\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\r\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\r\nWhere hearing should not latch them\r\n\r\n   Macd. What concerne they,\r\nThe generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe\r\nDue to some single brest?\r\n  Rosse. No minde that's honest\r\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\r\nPertaines to you alone\r\n\r\n   Macd. If it be mine\r\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,\r\nWhich shall possesse them with the heauiest sound\r\nthat euer yet they heard\r\n\r\n   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\r\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\r\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\r\nTo adde the death of you\r\n\r\n   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:\r\nWhat man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:\r\nGiue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,\r\nWhispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake\r\n\r\n   Macd. My Children too?\r\n  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found\r\n\r\n   Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?\r\n  Rosse. I haue said\r\n\r\n   Malc. Be comforted.\r\nLet's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,\r\nTo cure this deadly greefe\r\n\r\n   Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?\r\nDid you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?\r\nWhat, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme\r\nAt one fell swoope?\r\n  Malc. Dispute it like a man\r\n\r\n   Macd. I shall do so:\r\nBut I must also feele it as a man;\r\nI cannot but remember such things were\r\nThat were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,\r\nAnd would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,\r\nThey were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,\r\nNot for their owne demerits, but for mine\r\nFell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now\r\n\r\n   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe\r\nConuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it\r\n\r\n   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,\r\nAnd Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,\r\nCut short all intermission: Front to Front,\r\nBring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe\r\nWithin my Swords length set him, if he scape\r\nHeauen forgiue him too\r\n\r\n   Mal. This time goes manly:\r\nCome go we to the King, our Power is ready,\r\nOur lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth\r\nIs ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue\r\nPut on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,\r\nThe Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nActus Quintus. Scena Prima.\r\n\r\nEnter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.\r\n\r\n  Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can\r\nperceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last\r\nwalk'd?\r\n  Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue\r\nseene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon\r\nher, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,\r\nwrite vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne\r\nto bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe\r\n\r\n   Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at\r\nonce the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.\r\nIn this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other\r\nactuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard\r\nher say?\r\n  Gent. That Sir, which I will not report after her\r\n\r\n   Doct. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should\r\n\r\n   Gent.

How came she by that light?\r\n  Gent. Why it stood by her: she ha's light by her continually,\r\n'tis her command\r\n\r\n   Doct. You see her eyes are open\r\n\r\n   Gent. I, but their sense are shut\r\n\r\n   Doct. What is it she do's now?\r\nLooke how she rubbes her hands\r\n\r\n   Gent. It is an accustom'd action with her, to seeme\r\nthus washing her hands: I haue knowne her continue in\r\nthis a quarter of an houre\r\n\r\n   Lad. Yet heere's a spot\r\n\r\n   Doct. Heark, she speaks, I will set downe what comes\r\nfrom her, to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly\r\n\r\n   La. Out damned spot: out I say.

Fye, my Lord, fie,\r\na Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes\r\nit, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who\r\nwould haue thought the olde man to haue had so much\r\nblood in him\r\n\r\n   Doct. Do you marke that?\r\n  Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?\r\nWhat will these hands ne're be cleane? No more o'that\r\nmy Lord, no more o'that: you marre all with this starting\r\n\r\n   Doct. Go too, go too:\r\nYou haue knowne what you should not\r\n\r\n   Gent. She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure\r\nof that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne\r\n\r\n   La. Heere's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes\r\nof Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.\r\nOh, oh, oh\r\n\r\n   Doct. What a sigh is there? The hart is sorely charg'd\r\n\r\n   Gent. I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,\r\nfor the dignity of the whole body\r\n\r\n   Doct. Well, well, well\r\n\r\n   Gent. Pray God it be sir\r\n\r\n   Doct. This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue\r\nknowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue\r\ndyed holily in their beds\r\n\r\n   Lad. Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,\r\nlooke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo's buried;\r\nhe cannot come out on's graue\r\n\r\n   Doct. Euen so?\r\n  Lady.

Will she go now to bed?\r\n  Gent. Directly\r\n\r\n   Doct. Foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds\r\nDo breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes\r\nTo their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets:\r\nMore needs she the Diuine, then the Physitian:\r\nGod, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,\r\nRemoue from her the meanes of all annoyance,\r\nAnd still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,\r\nMy minde she ha's mated, and amaz'd my sight.\r\nI thinke, but dare not speake\r\n\r\n   Gent.

What do's the Tyrant\r\n\r\n   Cath. Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies:\r\nSome say hee's mad: Others, that lesser hate him,\r\nDo call it valiant Fury, but for certaine\r\nHe cannot buckle his distemper'd cause\r\nWithin the belt of Rule\r\n\r\n   Ang. Now do's he feele\r\nHis secret Murthers sticking on his hands,\r\nNow minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith-breach:\r\nThose he commands, moue onely in command,\r\nNothing in loue: Now do's he feele his Title\r\nHang loose about him, like a Giants Robe\r\nVpon a dwarfish Theefe\r\n\r\n   Ment.

Well, march we on,\r\nTo giue Obedience, where 'tis truly ow'd:\r\nMeet we the Med'cine of the sickly Weale,\r\nAnd with him poure we in our Countries purge,\r\nEach drop of vs\r\n\r\n   Lenox.

I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares:\r\nThe time ha's beene, my sences would haue cool'd\r\nTo heare a Night-shrieke, and my Fell of haire\r\nWould at a dismall Treatise rowze, and stirre\r\nAs life were in't. I haue supt full with horrors,\r\nDirenesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts\r\nCannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry?\r\n  Sey. The Queene (my Lord) is dead\r\n\r\n   Macb. She should haue dy'de heereafter;\r\nThere would haue beene a time for such a word:\r\nTo morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow,\r\nCreepes in this petty pace from day to day,\r\nTo the last Syllable of Recorded time:\r\nAnd all our yesterdayes, haue lighted Fooles\r\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, breefe Candle,\r\nLife's but a walking Shadow, a poore Player,\r\nThat struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,\r\nAnd then is heard no more. It is a Tale\r\nTold by an Ideot, full of sound and fury\r\nSignifying nothing.\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\nThou com'st to vse thy Tongue: thy Story quickly\r\n\r\n   Mes. Gracious my Lord,\r\nI should report that which I say I saw,\r\nBut know not how to doo't\r\n\r\n   Macb. Well, say sir\r\n\r\n   Mes. As I did stand my watch vpon the Hill\r\nI look'd toward Byrnane, and anon me thought\r\nThe Wood began to moue\r\n\r\n   Macb. Lyar, and Slaue\r\n\r\n   Mes. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:\r\nWithin this three Mile may you see it comming.\r\nI say, a mouing Groue\r\n\r\n   Macb. If thou speak'st false,\r\nVpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue\r\nTill Famine cling thee: If thy speech be sooth,\r\nI care not if thou dost for me as much.\r\nI pull in Resolution, and begin\r\nTo doubt th' Equiuocation of the Fiend,\r\nThat lies like truth. Feare not, till Byrnane Wood\r\nDo come to Dunsinane, and now a Wood\r\nComes toward Dunsinane. Arme, Arme, and out,\r\nIf this which he auouches, do's appeare,\r\nThere is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.\r\nI 'ginne to be a-weary of the Sun,\r\nAnd wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.\r\nRing the Alarum Bell, blow Winde, come wracke,\r\nAt least wee'l dye with Harnesse on our backe.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nScena Sexta.\r\n\r\nDrumme and Colours.

Worthy Macduffe, and wee\r\nShall take vpon's what else remaines to do,\r\nAccording to our order\r\n\r\n   Sey. Fare you well:\r\nDo we but finde the Tyrants power to night,\r\nLet vs be beaten, if we cannot fight\r\n\r\n   Macd.

Such a one\r\nAm I to feare, or none.\r\nEnter young Seyward.\r\n\r\n  Y.Sey. What is thy name?\r\n  Macb. Thou'lt be affraid to heare it\r\n\r\n   Y.Sey. No: though thou call'st thy selfe a hoter name\r\nThen any is in hell\r\n\r\n   Macb. My name's Macbeth\r\n\r\n   Y.Sey. The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title\r\nMore hatefull to mine eare\r\n\r\n   Macb. No: nor more fearefull\r\n\r\n   Y.Sey. Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant, with my Sword\r\nIle proue the lye thou speak'st.\r\n\r\nFight, and young Seyward slaine.\r\n\r\n  Macb.

There thou should'st be,\r\nBy this great clatter, one of greatest note\r\nSeemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,\r\nAnd more I begge not.\r\n\r\nExit. Alarums.\r\n\r\nEnter Malcolme and Seyward.\r\n\r\n  Sey. This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:\r\nThe Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,\r\nThe Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,\r\nThe day almost it selfe professes yours,\r\nAnd little is to do\r\n\r\n   Malc.

Of all men else I haue auoyded thee:\r\nBut get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'd\r\nWith blood of thine already\r\n\r\n   Macd. I haue no words,\r\nMy voice is in my Sword, thou bloodier Villaine\r\nThen tearmes can giue thee out.\r\n\r\nFight: Alarum\r\n\r\n  Macb. Thou loosest labour\r\nAs easie may'st thou the intrenchant Ayre\r\nWith thy keene Sword impresse, as make me bleed:\r\nLet fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests,\r\nI beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeld\r\nTo one of woman borne\r\n\r\n   Macd. Dispaire thy Charme,\r\nAnd let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd\r\nTell thee, Macduffe was from his Mothers womb\r\nVntimely ript\r\n\r\n   Macb. Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;\r\nFor it hath Cow'd my better part of man:\r\nAnd be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,\r\nThat palter with vs in a double sence,\r\nThat keepe the word of promise to our eare,\r\nAnd breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee\r\n\r\n   Macd. Then yeeld thee Coward,\r\nAnd liue to be the shew, and gaze o'th' time.\r\nWee'l haue thee, as our rarer Monsters are\r\nPainted vpon a pole, and vnder-writ,\r\nHeere may you see the Tyrant\r\n\r\n   Macb.

I would the Friends we misse, were safe arriu'd\r\n\r\n   Sey. Some must go off: and yet by these I see,\r\nSo great a day as this is cheapely bought\r\n\r\n   Mal. Macduffe is missing, and your Noble Sonne\r\n\r\n   Rosse. Your son my Lord, ha's paid a souldiers debt,\r\nHe onely liu'd but till he was a man,\r\nThe which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'd\r\nIn the vnshrinking station where he fought,\r\nBut like a man he dy'de\r\n\r\n   Sey.

I, on the Front\r\n\r\n   Sey. Why then, Gods Soldier be he:\r\nHad I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,\r\nI would not wish them to a fairer death:\r\nAnd so his Knell is knoll'd\r\n\r\n   Mal. Hee's worth more sorrow,\r\nand that Ile spend for him\r\n\r\n   Sey. He's worth no more,\r\nThey say he parted well, and paid his score,\r\nAnd so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.\r\nEnter Macduffe, with Macbeths head.\r\n\r\n  Macd.

Nine, or ten times\r\nI had thought t'haue yerk'd him here vnder the Ribbes\r\n\r\n   Othello. 'Tis better as it is\r\n\r\n   Iago. Nay but he prated,\r\nAnd spoke such scuruy, and prouoking termes\r\nAgainst your Honor, that with the little godlinesse I haue\r\nI did full hard forbeare him. But I pray you Sir,\r\nAre you fast married? Be assur'd of this,\r\nThat the Magnifico is much belou'd,\r\nAnd hath in his effect a voice potentiall\r\nAs double as the Dukes: He will diuorce you.\r\nOr put vpon you, what restraint or greeuance,\r\nThe Law (with all his might, to enforce it on)\r\nWill giue him Cable\r\n\r\n   Othel. Let him do his spight;\r\nMy Seruices, which I haue done the Signorie\r\nShall out-tongue his Complaints. 'Tis yet to know,\r\nWhich when I know, that boasting is an Honour,\r\nI shall promulgate. I fetch my life and being,\r\nFrom Men of Royall Seige. And my demerites\r\nMay speake (vnbonnetted) to as proud a Fortune\r\nAs this that I haue reach'd. For know Iago,\r\nBut that I loue the gentle Desdemona,\r\nI would not my vnhoused free condition\r\nPut into Circumscription, and Confine,\r\nFor the Seas worth.

The Seruants of the Dukes?\r\nAnd my Lieutenant?\r\nThe goodnesse of the Night vpon you (Friends)\r\nWhat is the Newes?\r\n  Cassio. The Duke do's greet you (Generall)\r\nAnd he requires your haste, Post-haste appearance,\r\nEuen on the instant\r\n\r\n   Othello. What is the matter, thinke you?\r\n  Cassio. Something from Cyprus, as I may diuine:\r\nIt is a businesse of some heate. The Gallies\r\nHaue sent a dozen sequent Messengers\r\nThis very night, at one anothers heeles:\r\nAnd many of the Consuls, rais'd and met,\r\nAre at the Dukes already.

Oh thou foule Theefe,\r\nWhere hast thou stow'd my Daughter?\r\nDamn'd as thou art, thou hast enchaunted her\r\nFor Ile referre me to all things of sense,\r\n(If she in Chaines of Magick were not bound)\r\nWhether a Maid, so tender, Faire, and Happie,\r\nSo opposite to Marriage, that she shun'd\r\nThe wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation,\r\nWould euer haue (t' encurre a generall mocke)\r\nRun from her Guardage to the sootie bosome,\r\nOf such a thing as thou: to feare, not to delight?\r\nIudge me the world, if 'tis not grosse in sense,\r\nThat thou hast practis'd on her with foule Charmes,\r\nAbus'd her delicate Youth, with Drugs or Minerals,\r\nThat weakens Motion. Ile haue't disputed on,\r\n'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking;\r\nI therefore apprehend and do attach thee,\r\nFor an abuser of the World, a practiser\r\nOf Arts inhibited, and out of warrant;\r\nLay hold vpon him, if he do resist\r\nSubdue him, at his perill\r\n\r\n   Othe. Hold your hands\r\nBoth you of my inclining, and the rest.\r\nWere it my Cue to fight, I should haue knowne it\r\nWithout a Prompter. Whether will you that I goe\r\nTo answere this your charge?\r\n  Bra. To Prison, till fit time\r\nOf Law, and course of direct Session\r\nCall thee to answer\r\n\r\n   Othe. What if I do obey?\r\nHow may the Duke be therewith satisfi'd,\r\nWhose Messengers are heere about my side,\r\nVpon some present businesse of the State,\r\nTo bring me to him\r\n\r\n   Officer. 'Tis true most worthy Signior,\r\nThe Dukes in Counsell, and your Noble selfe,\r\nI am sure is sent for\r\n\r\n   Bra. How? The Duke in Counsell?\r\nIn this time of the night? Bring him away;\r\nMine's not an idle Cause. The Duke himselfe,\r\nOr any of my Brothers of the State,\r\nCannot but feele this wrong, as 'twere their owne:\r\nFor if such Actions may haue passage free,\r\nBond-slaues, and Pagans shall our Statesmen be.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nScaena Tertia.\r\n\r\nEnter Duke, Senators, and Officers.\r\n\r\n  Duke. There's no composition in this Newes,\r\nThat giues them Credite\r\n\r\n   1.Sen. Indeed, they are disproportioned;\r\nMy Letters say, a Hundred and seuen Gallies\r\n\r\n   Duke. And mine a Hundred fortie\r\n\r\n   2.Sena. And mine two Hundred:\r\nBut though they iumpe not on a iust accompt,\r\n(As in these Cases where the ayme reports,\r\n'Tis oft with difference) yet do they all confirme\r\nA Turkish Fleete, and bearing vp to Cyprus\r\n\r\n   Duke. Nay, it is possible enough to iudgement:\r\nI do not so secure me in the Error,\r\nBut the maine Article I do approue\r\nIn fearefull sense\r\n\r\n   Saylor within. What hoa, what hoa, what hoa.\r\n\r\nEnter Saylor.\r\n\r\n  Officer. A Messenger from the Gallies\r\n\r\n   Duke. Now? What's the businesse?\r\n  Sailor. The Turkish Preparation makes for Rhodes,\r\nSo was I bid report here to the State,\r\nBy Signior Angelo\r\n\r\n   Duke. How say you by this change?\r\n  1.Sen. This cannot be\r\nBy no assay of reason. 'Tis a Pageant\r\nTo keepe vs in false gaze, when we consider\r\nTh' importancie of Cyprus to the Turke;\r\nAnd let our selues againe but vnderstand,\r\nThat as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes,\r\nSo may he with more facile question beare it,\r\nFor that it stands not in such Warrelike brace,\r\nBut altogether lackes th' abilities\r\nThat Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,\r\nWe must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull,\r\nTo leaue that latest, which concernes him first,\r\nNeglecting an attempt of ease, and gaine\r\nTo wake, and wage a danger profitlesse\r\n\r\n   Duke. Nay, in all confidence he's not for Rhodes\r\n\r\n   Officer. Here is more Newes.\r\n\r\nEnter a Messenger.\r\n\r\n  Messen. The Ottamites, Reueren'd, and Gracious,\r\nSteering with due course toward the Ile of Rhodes,\r\nHaue there inioynted them with an after Fleete\r\n\r\n   1.Sen. I, so I thought: how many, as you guesse?\r\n  Mess. Of thirtie Saile: and now they do re-stem\r\nTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearance\r\nTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,\r\nYour trustie and most Valiant Seruitour,\r\nWith his free dutie, recommends you thus,\r\nAnd prayes you to beleeue him\r\n\r\n   Duke. 'Tis certaine then for Cyprus:\r\nMarcus Luccicos is not he in Towne?\r\n  1.Sen. He's now in Florence\r\n\r\n   Duke. Write from vs,\r\nTo him, Post, Post-haste, dispatch\r\n\r\n   1.Sen. Here comes Brabantio, and the Valiant Moore.\r\n\r\nEnter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Rodorigo, and Officers.\r\n\r\n  Duke. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you,\r\nAgainst the generall Enemy Ottoman.\r\nI did not see you: welcome gentle Signior,\r\nWe lack't your Counsaile, and your helpe to night\r\n\r\n   Bra. So did I yours: Good your Grace pardon me.\r\nNeither my place, nor ought I heard of businesse\r\nHath rais'd me from my bed; nor doth the generall care\r\nTake hold on me. For my perticular griefe\r\nIs of so flood-gate, and ore-bearing Nature,\r\nThat it engluts, and swallowes other sorrowes,\r\nAnd it is still it selfe\r\n\r\n   Duke. Why? What's the matter?\r\n  Bra. My Daughter: oh my Daughter!\r\n  Sen. Dead?\r\n  Bra. I, to me.\r\nShe is abus'd, stolne from me, and corrupted\r\nBy Spels, and Medicines, bought of Mountebanks;\r\nFor Nature, so prepostrously to erre,\r\n(Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,)\r\nSans witch-craft could not\r\n\r\n   Duke. Who ere he be, that in this foule proceeding\r\nHath thus beguil'd your Daughter of her selfe,\r\nAnd you of her; the bloodie Booke of Law,\r\nYou shall your selfe read, in the bitter letter,\r\nAfter your owne sense: yea, though our proper Son\r\nStood in your Action\r\n\r\n   Bra. Humbly I thanke your Grace,\r\nHere is the man; this Moore, whom now it seemes\r\nYour speciall Mandate, for the State affaires\r\nHath hither brought\r\n\r\n   All. We are verie sorry for't\r\n\r\n   Duke. What in your owne part, can you say to this?\r\n  Bra. Nothing, but this is so\r\n\r\n   Othe. Most Potent, Graue, and Reueren'd Signiors,\r\nMy very Noble, and approu'd good Masters;\r\nThat I haue tane away this old mans Daughter,\r\nIt is most true: true I haue married her;\r\nThe verie head, and front of my offending,\r\nHath this extent; no more. Rude am I, in my speech,\r\nAnd little bless'd with the soft phrase of Peace;\r\nFor since these Armes of mine, had seuen yeares pith,\r\nTill now, some nine Moones wasted, they haue vs'd\r\nTheir deerest action, in the Tented Field:\r\nAnd little of this great world can I speake,\r\nMore then pertaines to Feats of Broiles, and Battaile,\r\nAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause,\r\nIn speaking for my selfe. Yet, (by your gratious patience)\r\nI will a round vn-varnish'd Tale deliuer,\r\nOf my whole course of Loue.\r\nWhat Drugges, what Charmes,\r\nWhat Coniuration, and what mighty Magicke,\r\n(For such proceeding I am charg'd withall)\r\nI won his Daughter\r\n\r\n   Bra. A Maiden, neuer bold:\r\nOf Spirit so still, and quiet, that her Motion\r\nBlush'd at her selfe, and she, in spight of Nature,\r\nOf Yeares, of Country, Credite, euery thing\r\nTo fall in Loue, with what she fear'd to looke on;\r\nIt is a iudgement main'd, and most imperfect.\r\nThat will confesse Perfection so could erre\r\nAgainst all rules of Nature, and must be driuen\r\nTo find out practises of cunning hell\r\nWhy this should be. I therefore vouch againe,\r\nThat with some Mixtures, powrefull o're the blood,\r\nOr with some Dram, (coniur'd to this effect)\r\nHe wrought vpon her.\r\nTo vouch this, is no proofe,\r\nWithout more wider, and more ouer Test\r\nThen these thin habits, and poore likely-hoods\r\nOf moderne seeming, do prefer against him\r\n\r\n   Sen. But Othello, speake,\r\nDid you, by indirect, and forced courses\r\nSubdue, and poyson this yong Maides affections?\r\nOr came it by request, and such faire question\r\nAs soule, to soule affordeth?\r\n  Othel. I do beseech you,\r\nSend for the Lady to the Sagitary,\r\nAnd let her speake of me before her Father;\r\nIf you do finde me foule, in her report,\r\nThe Trust, the Office, I do hold of you,\r\nNot onely take away, but let your Sentence\r\nEuen fall vpon my life\r\n\r\n   Duke. Fetch Desdemona hither\r\n\r\n   Othe. Aunciant, conduct them:\r\nYou best know the place.\r\nAnd tell she come, as truely as to heauen,\r\nI do confesse the vices of my blood,\r\nSo iustly to your Graue eares, Ile present\r\nHow I did thriue in this faire Ladies loue,\r\nAnd she in mine\r\n\r\n   Duke. Say it Othello\r\n\r\n   Othe. Her Father lou'd me, oft inuited me:\r\nStill question'd me the Storie of my life,\r\nFrom yeare to yeare: the Battaile, Sieges, Fortune,\r\nThat I haue past.\r\nI ran it through, euen from my boyish daies,\r\nToth' very moment that he bad me tell it.\r\nWherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:\r\nOf mouing Accidents by Flood and Field,\r\nOf haire-breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach;\r\nOf being taken by the Insolent Foe,\r\nAnd sold to slauery. Of my redemption thence,\r\nAnd portance in my Trauellours historie.\r\nWherein of Antars vast, and Desarts idle,\r\nRough Quarries, Rocks, Hills, whose head touch heauen,\r\nIt was my hint to speake. Such was my Processe,\r\nAnd of the Canibals that each others eate,\r\nThe Antropophague, and men whose heads\r\nGrew beneath their shoulders. These things to heare,\r\nWould Desdemona seriously incline:\r\nBut still the house Affaires would draw her hence:\r\nWhich euer as she could with haste dispatch,\r\nShe'l'd come againe, and with a greedie eare\r\nDeuoure vp my discourse. Which I obseruing,\r\nTooke once a pliant houre, and found good meanes\r\nTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,\r\nThat I would all my Pilgrimage dilate,\r\nWhereof by parcels she had something heard,\r\nBut not instinctiuely: I did consent,\r\nAnd often did beguile her of her teares,\r\nWhen I did speake of some distressefull stroke\r\nThat my youth suffer'd: My Storie being done,\r\nShe gaue me for my paines a world of kisses:\r\nShe swore in faith 'twas strange: 'twas passing strange,\r\n'Twas pittifull: 'twas wondrous pittifull.\r\nShe wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd\r\nThat Heauen had made her such a man. She thank'd me,\r\nAnd bad me, if I had a Friend that lou'd her,\r\nI should but teach him how to tell my Story,\r\nAnd that would wooe her. Vpon this hint I spake,\r\nShe lou'd me for the dangers I had past,\r\nAnd I lou'd her, that she did pitty them.\r\nThis onely is the witch-craft I haue vs'd.\r\nHere comes the Ladie: Let her witnesse it.\r\n\r\nEnter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.\r\n\r\n  Duke. I thinke this tale would win my Daughter too,\r\nGood Brabantio, take vp this mangled matter at the best:\r\nMen do their broken Weapons rather vse,\r\nThen their bare hands\r\n\r\n   Bra. I pray you heare her speake?\r\nIf she confesse that she was halfe the wooer,\r\nDestruction on my head, if my bad blame\r\nLight on the man. Come hither gentle Mistris,\r\nDo you perceiue in all this Noble Companie,\r\nWhere most you owe obedience?\r\n  Des. My Noble Father,\r\nI do perceiue heere a diuided dutie.\r\nTo you I am bound for life, and education:\r\nMy life and education both do learne me,\r\nHow to respect you. You are the Lord of duty,\r\nI am hitherto your Daughter. But heere's my Husband;\r\nAnd so much dutie, as my Mother shew'd\r\nTo you, preferring you before her Father:\r\nSo much I challenge, that I may professe\r\nDue to the Moore my Lord\r\n\r\n   Bra. God be with you: I haue done.\r\nPlease it your Grace, on to the State Affaires;\r\nI had rather to adopt a Child, then get it.\r\nCome hither Moore;\r\nI here do giue thee that with all my heart,\r\nWhich but thou hast already, with all my heart\r\nI would keepe from thee. For your sake (Iewell)\r\nI am glad at soule, I haue no other Child,\r\nFor thy escape would teach me Tirranie\r\nTo hang clogges on them. I haue done my Lord\r\n\r\n   Duke. Let me speake like your selfe:\r\nAnd lay a Sentence,\r\nWhich as a grise, or step may helpe these Louers.\r\nWhen remedies are past, the griefes are ended\r\nBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.\r\nTo mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon,\r\nIs the next way to draw new mischiefe on.\r\nWhat cannot be preseru'd, when Fortune takes:\r\nPatience, her Iniury a mock'ry makes.\r\nThe rob'd that smiles, steales something from the Thiefe,\r\nHe robs himselfe, that spends a bootelesse griefe\r\n\r\n   Bra. So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile,\r\nWe loose it not so long as we can smile:\r\nHe beares the Sentence well, that nothing beares,\r\nBut the free comfort which from thence he heares.\r\nBut he beares both the Sentence, and the sorrow,\r\nThat to pay griefe, must of poore Patience borrow.\r\nThese Sentences, to Sugar, or to Gall,\r\nBeing strong on both sides, are Equiuocall.\r\nBut words are words, I neuer yet did heare:\r\nThat the bruized heart was pierc'd through the eares.\r\nI humbly beseech you proceed to th' Affaires of State\r\n\r\n   Duke. The Turke with a most mighty Preparation\r\nmakes for Cyprus: Othello, the Fortitude of the place is\r\nbest knowne to you. And though we haue there a Substitute\r\nof most allowed sufficiencie; yet opinion, a more\r\nsoueraigne Mistris of Effects, throwes a more safer\r\nvoice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber\r\nthe glosse of your new Fortunes, with this more stubborne,\r\nand boystrous expedition\r\n\r\n   Othe. The Tirant Custome, most Graue Senators,\r\nHath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre\r\nMy thrice-driuen bed of Downe. I do agnize\r\nA Naturall and prompt Alacratie,\r\nI finde in hardnesse: and do vndertake\r\nThis present Warres against the Ottamites.\r\nMost humbly therefore bending to your State,\r\nI craue fit disposition for my Wife,\r\nDue reference of Place, and Exhibition,\r\nWith such Accomodation and besort\r\nAs leuels with her breeding\r\n\r\n   Duke. Why at her Fathers?\r\n  Bra. I will not haue it so\r\n\r\n   Othe. Nor I\r\n\r\n   Des. Nor would I there recide,\r\nTo put my Father in impatient thoughts\r\nBy being in his eye. Most Gracious Duke,\r\nTo my vnfolding, lend your prosperous eare,\r\nAnd let me finde a Charter in your voice\r\nT' assist my simplenesse\r\n\r\n   Duke. What would you Desdemona?\r\n  Des. That I loue the Moore, to liue with him,\r\nMy downe-right violence, and storme of Fortunes,\r\nMay trumpet to the world. My heart's subdu'd\r\nEuen to the very quality of my Lord;\r\nI saw Othello's visage in his mind,\r\nAnd to his Honours and his valiant parts,\r\nDid I my soule and Fortunes consecrate.\r\nSo that (deere Lords) if I be left behind\r\nA Moth of Peace, and he go to the Warre,\r\nThe Rites for why I loue him, are bereft me:\r\nAnd I a heauie interim shall support\r\nBy his deere absence. Let me go with him\r\n\r\n   Othe. Let her haue your voice.\r\nVouch with me Heauen, I therefore beg it not\r\nTo please the pallate of my Appetite:\r\nNor to comply with heat the yong affects\r\nIn my defunct, and proper satisfaction.\r\nBut to be free, and bounteous to her minde:\r\nAnd Heauen defend your good soules, that you thinke\r\nI will your serious and great businesse scant\r\nWhen she is with me. No, when light wing'd Toyes\r\nOf feather'd Cupid, seele with wanton dulnesse\r\nMy speculatiue, and offic'd Instrument:\r\nThat my Disports corrupt, and taint my businesse:\r\nLet House-wiues make a Skillet of my Helme,\r\nAnd all indigne, and base aduersities,\r\nMake head against my Estimation\r\n\r\n   Duke. Be it as you shall priuately determine,\r\nEither for her stay, or going: th' Affaire cries hast:\r\nAnd speed must answer it\r\n\r\n   Sen. You must away to night\r\n\r\n   Othe. With all my heart\r\n\r\n   Duke. At nine i'th' morning, here wee'l meete againe.\r\nOthello, leaue some Officer behind\r\nAnd he shall our Commission bring to you:\r\nAnd such things else of qualitie and respect\r\nAs doth import you\r\n\r\n   Othe. So please your Grace, my Ancient,\r\nA man he is of honesty and trust:\r\nTo his conueyance I assigne my wife,\r\nWith what else needfull, your good Grace shall think\r\nTo be sent after me\r\n\r\n   Duke. Let it be so:\r\nGood night to euery one. And Noble Signior,\r\nIf Vertue no delighted Beautie lacke,\r\nYour Son-in-law is farre more Faire then Blacke\r\n\r\n   Sen. Adieu braue Moore, vse Desdemona well\r\n\r\n   Bra. Looke to her (Moore) if thou hast eies to see:\r\nShe ha's deceiu'd her Father, and may thee.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Othe. My life vpon her faith. Honest Iago,\r\nMy Desdemona must I leaue to thee:\r\nI prythee let thy wife attend on her,\r\nAnd bring them after in the best aduantage.\r\nCome Desdemona, I haue but an houre\r\nOf Loue, of wordly matter, and direction\r\nTo spend with thee. We must obey the time.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Rod. Iago\r\n\r\n   Iago. What saist thou Noble heart?\r\n  Rod. What will I do, think'st thou?\r\n  Iago. Why go to bed and sleepe\r\n\r\n   Rod. I will incontinently drowne my selfe\r\n\r\n   Iago. If thou do'st, I shall neuer loue thee after. Why\r\nthou silly Gentleman?\r\n  Rod. It is sillynesse to liue, when to liue is torment:\r\nand then haue we a prescription to dye, when death is\r\nour Physition\r\n\r\n   Iago. Oh villanous: I haue look'd vpon the world\r\nfor foure times seuen yeares, and since I could distinguish\r\nbetwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that\r\nknew how to loue himselfe. Ere I would say, I would\r\ndrowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen, I would\r\nchange my Humanity with a Baboone\r\n\r\n   Rod. What should I do? I confesse it is my shame\r\nto be so fond, but it is not in my vertue to amend it\r\n\r\n   Iago. Vertue? A figge, 'tis in our selues that we are\r\nthus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which,\r\nour Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Nettels,\r\nor sowe Lettice: Set Hisope, and weede vp Time:\r\nSupplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or distract it with\r\nmany: either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse, or manured\r\nwith Industry, why the power, and Corrigeable authoritie\r\nof this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues\r\nhad not one Scale of Reason, to poize another of Sensualitie,\r\nthe blood, and basenesse of our Natures would\r\nconduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions. But we\r\nhaue Reason to coole our raging Motions, our carnall\r\nStings, or vnbitted Lusts: whereof I take this, that you\r\ncall Loue, to be a Sect, or Seyen\r\n\r\n   Rod. It cannot be\r\n\r\n   Iago. It is meerly a Lust of the blood, and a permission\r\nof the will. Come, be a man: drowne thy selfe? Drown\r\nCats, and blind Puppies. I haue profest me thy Friend,\r\nand I confesse me knit to thy deseruing, with Cables of\r\nperdurable toughnesse. I could neuer better steed thee\r\nthen now. Put Money in thy purse: follow thou the\r\nWarres, defeate thy fauour, with an vsurp'd Beard. I say\r\nput Money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona\r\nshould continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in\r\nthy purse: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commencement\r\nin her, and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration,\r\nput but Money in thy purse. These Moores\r\nare changeable in their wils: fill thy purse with Money.\r\nThe Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts,\r\nshalbe to him shortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She\r\nmust change for youth: when she is sated with his body\r\nshe will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Money\r\nin thy purse. If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe, do\r\nit a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Money\r\nthou canst: If Sanctimonie, and a fraile vow, betwixt\r\nan erring Barbarian, and super-subtle Venetian be\r\nnot too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of hell, thou\r\nshalt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drowning\r\nthy selfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou rather\r\nto be hang'd in Compassing thy ioy, then to be\r\ndrown'd, and go without her\r\n\r\n   Rodo. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on\r\nthe issue?\r\n  Iago. Thou art sure of me: Go make Money: I haue\r\ntold thee often, and I re-tell thee againe, and againe, I\r\nhate the Moore. My cause is hearted; thine hath no lesse\r\nreason. Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge, against\r\nhim. If thou canst Cuckold him, thou dost thy selfe a\r\npleasure, me a sport. There are many Euents in the\r\nWombe of Time, which wilbe deliuered. Trauerse, go,\r\nprouide thy Money. We will haue more of this to morrow.\r\nAdieu\r\n\r\n   Rod. Where shall we meete i'th' morning?\r\n  Iago. At my Lodging\r\n\r\n   Rod. Ile be with thee betimes\r\n\r\n   Iago. Go too, farewell. Do you heare Rodorigo?\r\n  Rod. Ile sell all my Land.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Iago. Thus do I euer make my Foole, my purse:\r\nFor I mine owne gain'd knowledge should prophane\r\nIf I would time expend with such Snipe,\r\nBut for my Sport, and Profit: I hate the Moore,\r\nAnd it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets\r\nShe ha's done my Office. I know not if't be true,\r\nBut I, for meere suspition in that kinde,\r\nWill do, as if for Surety. He holds me well,\r\nThe better shall my purpose worke on him:\r\nCassio's a proper man: Let me see now,\r\nTo get his Place, and to plume vp my will\r\nIn double Knauery. How? How? Let's see.\r\nAfter some time, to abuse Othello's eares,\r\nThat he is too familiar with his wife:\r\nHe hath a person, and a smooth dispose\r\nTo be suspected: fram'd to make women false.\r\nThe Moore is of a free, and open Nature,\r\nThat thinkes men honest, that but seeme to be so,\r\nAnd will as tenderly be lead by'th' Nose\r\nAs Asses are:\r\nI hau't: it is engendred: Hell, and Night,\r\nMust bring this monstrous Birth, to the worlds light.\r\n\r\nActus Secundus. Scena Prima.\r\n\r\nEnter Montano, and two Gentlemen.\r\n\r\n  Mon. What from the Cape, can you discerne at Sea?\r\n  1.Gent. Nothing at all, it is a high wrought Flood:\r\nI cannot 'twixt the Heauen, and the Maine,\r\nDescry a Saile\r\n\r\n   Mon. Me thinks, the wind hath spoke aloud at Land,\r\nA fuller blast ne're shooke our Battlements:\r\nIf it hath ruffiand so vpon the Sea,\r\nWhat ribbes of Oake, when Mountaines melt on them,\r\nCan hold the Morties. What shall we heare of this?\r\n  2 A Segregation of the Turkish Fleet:\r\nFor do but stand vpon the Foaming Shore,\r\nThe chidden Billow seemes to pelt the Clowds,\r\nThe winde-shak'd-Surge, with high & monstrous Maine\r\nSeemes to cast water on the burning Beare,\r\nAnd quench the Guards of th' euer-fixed Pole:\r\nI neuer did like mollestation view\r\nOn the enchafed Flood\r\n\r\n   Men. If that the Turkish Fleete\r\nBe not enshelter'd, and embay'd, they are drown'd,\r\nIt is impossible to beare it out.\r\nEnter a Gentleman.\r\n\r\n  3 Newes Laddes: our warres are done:\r\nThe desperate Tempest hath so bang'd the Turkes,\r\nThat their designement halts. A Noble ship of Venice,\r\nHath seene a greeuous wracke and sufferance\r\nOn most part of their Fleet\r\n\r\n   Mon. How? Is this true?\r\n  3 The Ship is heere put in: A Verennessa, Michael Cassio\r\nLieutenant to the warlike Moore, Othello,\r\nIs come on Shore: the Moore himselfe at Sea,\r\nAnd is in full Commission heere for Cyprus\r\n\r\n   Mon. I am glad on't:\r\n'Tis a worthy Gouernour\r\n\r\n   3 But this same Cassio, though he speake of comfort,\r\nTouching the Turkish losse, yet he lookes sadly,\r\nAnd praye the Moore be safe; for they were parted\r\nWith fowle and violent Tempest\r\n\r\n   Mon. Pray Heauens he be:\r\nFor I haue seru'd him, and the man commands\r\nLike a full Soldier. Let's to the Sea-side (hoa)\r\nAs well to see the Vessell that's come in,\r\nAs to throw-out our eyes for braue Othello,\r\nEuen till we make the Maine, and th' Eriall blew,\r\nAn indistinct regard\r\n\r\n   Gent. Come, let's do so;\r\nFor euery Minute is expectancie\r\nOf more Arriuancie.\r\nEnter Cassio.\r\n\r\n  Cassi. Thankes you, the valiant of the warlike Isle,\r\nThat so approoue the Moore: Oh let the Heauens\r\nGiue him defence against the Elements,\r\nFor I haue lost him on a dangerous Sea\r\n\r\n   Mon. Is he well ship'd?\r\n  Cassio. His Barke is stoutly Timber'd, and his Pylot\r\nOf verie expert, and approu'd Allowance;\r\nTherefore my hope's (not surfetted to death)\r\nStand in bold Cure\r\n\r\n   Within. A Saile, a Saile, a Saile\r\n\r\n   Cassio. What noise?\r\n  Gent. The Towne is empty; on the brow o'th' Sea\r\nStand rankes of People and they cry, a Saile\r\n\r\n   Cassio. My hopes do shape him for the Gouernor\r\n\r\n   Gent. They do discharge their Shot of Courtesie,\r\nOur Friends, at least\r\n\r\n   Cassio. I pray you Sir, go forth,\r\nAnd giue vs truth who 'tis that is arriu'd\r\n\r\n   Gent. I shall.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Mon. But good Lieutenant, is your Generall wiu'd?\r\n  Cassio. Most fortunately: he hath atchieu'd a Maid\r\nThat paragons description, and wilde Fame:\r\nOne that excels the quirkes of Blazoning pens,\r\nAnd in th' essentiall Vesture of Creation,\r\nDo's tyre the Ingeniuer.\r\nEnter Gentleman.\r\n\r\nHow now? Who ha's put in?\r\n  Gent. 'Tis one Iago, Auncient to the Generall\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Ha's had most fauourable, and happie speed:\r\nTempests themselues, high Seas, and howling windes,\r\nThe gutter'd-Rockes, and Congregated Sands,\r\nTraitors ensteep'd, to enclogge the guiltlesse Keele,\r\nAs hauing sence of Beautie, do omit\r\nTheir mortall Natures, letting go safely by\r\nThe Diuine Desdemona\r\n\r\n   Mon. What is she?\r\n  Cassio. She that I spake of:\r\nOur great Captains Captaine,\r\nLeft in the conduct of the bold Iago,\r\nWhose footing heere anticipates our thoughts,\r\nA Senights speed. Great Ioue, Othello guard,\r\nAnd swell his Saile with thine owne powrefull breath,\r\nThat he may blesse this Bay with his tall Ship,\r\nMake loues quicke pants in Desdemonaes Armes,\r\nGiue renew'd fire to our extincted Spirits.\r\n\r\nEnter Desdemona, Iago, Rodorigo, and Aemilia.\r\n\r\nOh behold,\r\nThe Riches of the Ship is come on shore:\r\nYou men of Cyprus, let her haue your knees.\r\nHaile to thee Ladie: and the grace of Heauen,\r\nBefore, behinde thee, and on euery hand\r\nEnwheele thee round\r\n\r\n   Des. I thanke you, Valiant Cassio,\r\nWhat tydings can you tell of my Lord?\r\n  Cas. He is not yet arriu'd, nor know I ought\r\nBut that he's well, and will be shortly heere\r\n\r\n   Des. Oh, but I feare:\r\nHow lost you company?\r\n  Cassio. The great Contention of Sea, and Skies\r\nParted our fellowship. But hearke, a Saile\r\n\r\n   Within. A Saile, a Saile\r\n\r\n   Gent. They giue this greeting to the Cittadell:\r\nThis likewise is a Friend\r\n\r\n   Cassio. See for the Newes:\r\nGood Ancient, you are welcome. Welcome Mistris:\r\nLet it not gaule your patience (good Iago)\r\nThat I extend my Manners. 'Tis my breeding,\r\nThat giues me this bold shew of Curtesie\r\n\r\n   Iago. Sir, would she giue you so much of her lippes,\r\nAs of her tongue she oft bestowes on me,\r\nYou would haue enough\r\n\r\n   Des. Alas: she ha's no speech\r\n\r\n   Iago. Infaith too much:\r\nI finde it still, when I haue leaue to sleepe.\r\nMarry before your Ladyship, I grant,\r\nShe puts her tongue a little in her heart,\r\nAnd chides with thinking\r\n\r\n   aemil. You haue little cause to say so\r\n\r\n   Iago. Come on, come on: you are Pictures out of\r\ndoore: Bells in your Parlours: Wilde-Cats in your Kitchens:\r\nSaints in your Iniuries: Diuels being offended:\r\nPlayers in your Huswiferie, and Huswiues in your\r\nBeds\r\n\r\n   Des. Oh, fie vpon thee, Slanderer\r\n\r\n   Iago. Nay, it is true: or else I am a Turke,\r\nYou rise to play, and go to bed to worke.\r\nAemil. You shall not write my praise\r\n\r\n   Iago. No, let me not\r\n\r\n   Desde. What would'st write of me, if thou should'st\r\npraise me?\r\n  Iago. Oh, gentle Lady, do not put me too't,\r\nFor I am nothing, if not Criticall\r\n\r\n   Des. Come on, assay.\r\nThere's one gone to the Harbour?\r\n  Iago. I Madam\r\n\r\n   Des. I am not merry: but I do beguile\r\nThe thing I am, by seeming otherwise.\r\nCome, how would'st thou praise me?\r\n  Iago. I am about it, but indeed my inuention comes\r\nfrom my pate, as Birdlyme do's from Freeze, it pluckes\r\nout Braines and all. But my Muse labours, and thus she\r\nis deliuer'd.\r\nIf she be faire, and wise: fairenesse, and wit,\r\nThe ones for vse, the other vseth it\r\n\r\n   Des. Well prais'd:\r\nHow if she be Blacke and Witty?\r\n  Iago. If she be blacke, and thereto haue a wit,\r\nShe'le find a white, that shall her blacknesse fit\r\n\r\n   Des. Worse, and worse.\r\nAemil. How if Faire, and Foolish?\r\n  Iago. She neuer yet was foolish that was faire,\r\nFor euen her folly helpt her to an heire\r\n\r\n   Desde. These are old fond Paradoxes, to make Fooles\r\nlaugh i'th' Alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou\r\nfor her that's Foule, and Foolish\r\n\r\n   Iago. There's none so foule and foolish thereunto,\r\nBut do's foule pranks, which faire, and wise-ones do\r\n\r\n   Desde. Oh heauy ignorance: thou praisest the worst\r\nbest. But what praise could'st thou bestow on a deseruing\r\nwoman indeed? One, that in the authorithy of her\r\nmerit, did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it\r\nselfe\r\n\r\n   Iago. She that was euer faire, and neuer proud,\r\nHad Tongue at will, and yet was neuer loud:\r\nNeuer lackt Gold, and yet went neuer gay,\r\nFled from her wish, and yet said now I may.\r\nShe that being angred, her reuenge being nie,\r\nBad her wrong stay, and her displeasure flie:\r\nShe that in wisedome neuer was so fraile,\r\nTo change the Cods-head for the Salmons taile:\r\nShe that could thinke, and neu'r disclose her mind,\r\nSee Suitors following, and not looke behind:\r\nShe was a wight, (if euer such wightes were)\r\n  Des. To do what?\r\n  Iago. To suckle Fooles, and chronicle small Beere\r\n\r\n   Desde. Oh most lame and impotent conclusion. Do\r\nnot learne of him aemillia, though he be thy husband.\r\nHow say you (Cassio) is he not a most prophane, and liberall\r\nCounsailor?\r\n  Cassio. He speakes home (Madam) you may rellish\r\nhim more in the Souldier, then in the Scholler\r\n\r\n   Iago. He takes her by the palme: I, well said, whisper.\r\nWith as little a web as this, will I ensnare as great\r\na Fly as Cassio. I smile vpon her, do: I will giue thee\r\nin thine owne Courtship. You say true, 'tis so indeed.\r\nIf such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie,\r\nit had beene better you had not kiss'd your three fingers\r\nso oft, which now againe you are most apt to play\r\nthe Sir, in. Very good: well kiss'd, and excellent Curtsie:\r\n'tis so indeed. Yet againe, your fingers to your\r\nlippes? Would they were Cluster-pipes for your\r\nsake.\r\nThe Moore I know his Trumpet\r\n\r\n   Cassio. 'Tis truely so\r\n\r\n   Des. Let's meete him, and recieue him\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Loe, where he comes.\r\nEnter Othello, and Attendants.\r\n\r\n  Oth. O, my faire Warriour\r\n\r\n   Des. My deere Othello\r\n\r\n   Othe. It giues me wonder great, as my content\r\nTo see you heere before me.\r\nOh my Soules Ioy:\r\nIf after euery Tempest, come such Calmes,\r\nMay the windes blow, till they haue waken'd death:\r\nAnd let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas\r\nOlympus high: and duck againe as low,\r\nAs hell's from Heauen. If it were now to dye,\r\n'Twere now to be most happy. For I feare,\r\nMy Soule hath her content so absolute,\r\nThat not another comfort like to this,\r\nSucceedes in vnknowne Fate\r\n\r\n   Des. The Heauens forbid\r\nBut that our Loues\r\nAnd Comforts should encrease\r\nEuen as our dayes do grow\r\n\r\n   Othe. Amen to that (sweet Powers)\r\nI cannot speake enough of this content,\r\nIt stoppes me heere: it is too much of ioy.\r\nAnd this, and this the greatest discords be\r\nThat ere our hearts shall make\r\n\r\n   Iago. Oh you are well tun'd now: But Ile set downe\r\nthe peggs that make this Musicke, as honest as I am\r\n\r\n   Othe. Come: let vs to the Castle.\r\nNewes (Friends) our Warres are done:\r\nThe Turkes are drown'd.\r\nHow do's my old Acquaintance of this Isle?\r\n(Hony) you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus,\r\nI haue found great loue among'st them. Oh my Sweet,\r\nI prattle out of fashion, and I doate\r\nIn mine owne comforts. I prythee, good Iago,\r\nGo to the Bay, and disimbarke my Coffers:\r\nBring thou the Master to the Cittadell,\r\nHe is a good one, and his worthynesse\r\nDo's challenge much respect. Come Desdemona,\r\nOnce more well met at Cyprus.\r\n\r\nExit Othello and Desdemona.\r\n\r\n  Iago. Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour.\r\nCome thither, if thou be'st Valiant, (as they say base men\r\nbeing in Loue, haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures,\r\nmore then is natiue to them) list-me; the Lieutenant to\r\nnight watches on the Court of Guard. First, I must tell\r\nthee this: Desdemona, is directly in loue with him\r\n\r\n   Rod. With him? Why, 'tis not possible\r\n\r\n   Iago. Lay thy finger thus: and let thy soule be instructed.\r\nMarke me with what violence she first lou'd\r\nthe Moore, but for bragging, and telling her fantasticall\r\nlies. To loue him still for prating, let not thy discreet\r\nheart thinke it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight\r\nshall she haue to looke on the diuell? When the Blood\r\nis made dull with the Act of Sport, there should be a\r\ngame to enflame it, and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite.\r\nLouelinesse in fauour, simpathy in yeares, Manners,\r\nand Beauties: all which the Moore is defectiue in. Now\r\nfor want of these requir'd Conueniences, her delicate\r\ntendernesse wil finde it selfe abus'd, begin to heaue the,\r\ngorge, disrellish and abhorre the Moore, very Nature wil\r\ninstruct her in it, and compell her to some second choice.\r\nNow Sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and vnforc'd\r\nposition) who stands so eminent in the degree of\r\nthis Fortune, as Cassio do's: a knaue very voluble: no\r\nfurther conscionable, then in putting on the meere forme\r\nof Ciuill, and Humaine seeming, for the better compasse\r\nof his salt, and most hidden loose Affection? Why none,\r\nwhy none: A slipper, and subtle knaue, a finder of occasion:\r\nthat he's an eye can stampe, and counterfeit Aduantages,\r\nthough true Aduantage neuer present it selfe.\r\nA diuelish knaue: besides, the knaue is handsome, young:\r\nand hath all those requisites in him, that folly and greene\r\nmindes looke after. A pestilent compleat knaue, and the\r\nwoman hath found him already\r\n\r\n   Rodo. I cannot beleeue that in her, she's full of most\r\nbless'd condition\r\n\r\n   Iago. Bless'd figges-end. The Wine she drinkes is\r\nmade of grapes. If shee had beene bless'd, shee would\r\nneuer haue lou'd the Moore: Bless'd pudding. Didst thou\r\nnot see her paddle with the palme of his hand? Didst not\r\nmarke that?\r\n  Rod. Yes, that I did: but that was but curtesie\r\n\r\n   Iago . Leacherie by this hand: an Index, and obscure\r\nprologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts.\r\nThey met so neere with their lippes, that their breathes\r\nembrac'd together. Villanous thoughts Rodorigo, when\r\nthese mutabilities so marshall the way, hard at hand\r\ncomes the Master, and maine exercise, th' incorporate\r\nconclusion: Pish. But Sir, be you rul'd by me. I haue\r\nbrought you from Venice. Watch you to night: for\r\nthe Command, Ile lay't vpon you. Cassio knowes you\r\nnot: Ile not be farre from you. Do you finde some occasion\r\nto anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or\r\ntainting his discipline, or from what other course\r\nyou please, which the time shall more fauorably minister\r\n\r\n   Rod. Well\r\n\r\n   Iago. Sir, he's rash, and very sodaine in Choller: and\r\nhappely may strike at you, prouoke him that he may: for\r\neuen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny.\r\nWhose qualification shall come into no true taste againe,\r\nbut by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you\r\nhaue a shorter iourney to your desires, by the meanes I\r\nshall then haue to preferre them. And the impediment\r\nmost profitably remoued, without the which there were\r\nno expectation of our prosperitie\r\n\r\n   Rodo. I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity\r\n\r\n   Iago. I warrant thee. Meete me by and by at the\r\nCittadell. I must fetch his Necessaries a Shore. Farewell\r\n\r\n   Rodo. Adieu.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Iago. That Cassio loues her, I do well beleeu't:\r\nThat she loues him, 'tis apt, and of great Credite.\r\nThe Moore (howbeit that I endure him not)\r\nIs of a constant, louing, Noble Nature,\r\nAnd I dare thinke, he'le proue to Desdemona\r\nA most deere husband. Now I do loue her too,\r\nNot out of absolute Lust, (though peraduenture\r\nI stand accomptant for as great a sin)\r\nBut partely led to dyet my Reuenge,\r\nFor that I do suspect the lustie Moore\r\nHath leap'd into my Seate. The thought whereof,\r\nDoth (like a poysonous Minerall) gnaw my Inwardes:\r\nAnd nothing can, or shall content my Soule\r\nTill I am eeuen'd with him, wife, for wife.\r\nOr fayling so, yet that I put the Moore,\r\nAt least into a Ielouzie so strong\r\nThat iudgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,\r\nIf this poore Trash of Venice, whom I trace\r\nFor his quicke hunting, stand the putting on,\r\nIle haue our Michael Cassio on the hip,\r\nAbuse him to the Moore, in the right garbe\r\n(For I feare Cassio with my Night-Cape too)\r\nMake the Moore thanke me, loue me, and reward me,\r\nFor making him egregiously an Asse,\r\nAnd practising vpon his peace, and quiet,\r\nEuen to madnesse. 'Tis heere: but yet confus'd,\r\nKnaueries plaine face, is neuer seene, till vs'd.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Secunda.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello's Herald with a Proclamation.\r\n\r\n  Herald. It is Othello's pleasure, our Noble and Valiant\r\nGenerall. That vpon certaine tydings now arriu'd,\r\nimporting the meere perdition of the Turkish Fleete:\r\neuery man put himselfe into Triumph. Some to daunce,\r\nsome to make Bonfires, each man, to what Sport and\r\nReuels his addition leads him. For besides these beneficiall\r\nNewes, it is the Celebration of his Nuptiall. So\r\nmuch was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices\r\nare open, & there is full libertie of Feasting from this\r\npresent houre of fiue, till the Bell haue told eleuen.\r\nBlesse the Isle of Cyprus, and our Noble Generall Othello.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.\r\n\r\n  Othe. Good Michael, looke you to the guard to night.\r\nLet's teach our selues that Honourable stop,\r\nNot to out-sport discretion\r\n\r\n   Cas. Iago, hath direction what to do.\r\nBut notwithstanding with my personall eye\r\nWill I looke to't\r\n\r\n   Othe. Iago, is most honest:\r\nMichael, goodnight. To morrow with your earliest,\r\nLet me haue speech with you. Come my deere Loue,\r\nThe purchase made, the fruites are to ensue,\r\nThat profit's yet to come 'tweene me, and you.\r\nGoodnight.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\nEnter Iago.\r\n\r\n  Cas. Welcome Iago: we must to the Watch\r\n\r\n   Iago. Not this houre Lieutenant: 'tis not yet ten\r\no'th' clocke. Our Generall cast vs thus earely for the\r\nloue of his Desdemona: Who, let vs not therefore blame;\r\nhe hath not yet made wanton the night with her: and\r\nshe is sport for Ioue\r\n\r\n   Cas. She's a most exquisite Lady\r\n\r\n   Iago. And Ile warrant her, full of Game\r\n\r\n   Cas. Indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature\r\n\r\n   Iago. What an eye she ha's?\r\nMe thinkes it sounds a parley to prouocation\r\n\r\n   Cas. An inuiting eye:\r\nAnd yet me thinkes right modest\r\n\r\n   Iago. And when she speakes,\r\nIs it not an Alarum to Loue?\r\n  Cas. She is indeed perfection\r\n\r\n   Iago. Well: happinesse to their Sheetes. Come Lieutenant,\r\nI haue a stope of Wine, and heere without are a\r\nbrace of Cyprus Gallants, that would faine haue a measure\r\nto the health of blacke Othello\r\n\r\n   Cas. Not to night, good Iago, I haue very poore,\r\nand vnhappie Braines for drinking. I could well wish\r\nCurtesie would inuent some other Custome of entertainment\r\n\r\n   Iago. Oh, they are our Friends: but one Cup, Ile\r\ndrinke for you\r\n\r\n   Cassio. I haue drunke but one Cup to night, and that\r\nwas craftily qualified too: and behold what inouation\r\nit makes heere. I am infortunate in the infirmity, and\r\ndare not taske my weakenesse with any more\r\n\r\n   Iago. What man? 'Tis a night of Reuels, the Gallants\r\ndesire it\r\n\r\n   Cas. Where are they?\r\n  Iago. Heere, at the doore: I pray you call them in\r\n\r\n   Cas. Ile do't, but it dislikes me.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Iago. If I can fasten but one Cup vpon him\r\nWith that which he hath drunke to night alreadie,\r\nHe'l be as full of Quarrell, and offence\r\nAs my yong Mistris dogge.\r\nNow my sicke Foole Rodorigo,\r\nWhom Loue hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,\r\nTo Desdemona hath to night Carrows'd.\r\nPotations, pottle-deepe; and he's to watch.\r\nThree else of Cyprus, Noble swelling Spirites,\r\n(That hold their Honours in a wary distance,\r\nThe very Elements of this Warrelike Isle)\r\nHaue I to night fluster'd with flowing Cups,\r\nAnd they Watch too.\r\nNow 'mongst this Flocke of drunkards\r\nAm I put to our Cassio in some Action\r\nThat may offend the Isle. But here they come.\r\nEnter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen.\r\n\r\nIf Consequence do but approue my dreame,\r\nMy Boate sailes freely, both with winde and Streame\r\n\r\n   Cas. 'Fore heauen, they haue giuen me a rowse already\r\n\r\n   Mon. Good-faith a litle one: not past a pint, as I am a\r\nSouldier\r\n\r\n   Iago. Some Wine hoa.\r\nAnd let me the Cannakin clinke, clinke:\r\nAnd let me the Cannakin clinke.\r\nA Souldiers a man: Oh, mans life's but a span,\r\nWhy then let a Souldier drinke.\r\nSome Wine Boyes\r\n\r\n   Cas. 'Fore Heauen: an excellent Song\r\n\r\n   Iago. I learn'd it in England: where indeed they are\r\nmost potent in Potting. Your Dane, your Germaine,\r\nand your swag-belly'd Hollander, (drinke hoa) are\r\nnothing to your English\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Is your Englishmen so exquisite in his drinking?\r\n  Iago. Why, he drinkes you with facillitie, your Dane\r\ndead drunke. He sweates not to ouerthrow your Almaine.\r\nHe giues your Hollander a vomit, ere the next\r\nPottle can be fill'd\r\n\r\n   Cas. To the health of our Generall\r\n\r\n   Mon. I am for it Lieutenant: and Ile do you Iustice\r\n\r\n   Iago. Oh sweet England.\r\nKing Stephen was anda worthy Peere,\r\nHis Breeches cost him but a Crowne,\r\nHe held them Six pence all to deere,\r\nWith that he cal'd the Tailor Lowne:\r\nHe was a wight of high Renowne,\r\nAnd thou art but of low degree:\r\n'Tis Pride that pulls the Country downe,\r\nAnd take thy awl'd Cloake about thee.\r\nSome Wine hoa\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Why this is a more exquisite Song then the other\r\n\r\n   Iago. Will you heare't againe?\r\n  Cas. No: for I hold him to be vnworthy of his Place,\r\nthat do's those things. Well: heau'ns aboue all: and\r\nthere be soules must be saued, and there be soules must\r\nnot be saued\r\n\r\n   Iago. It's true, good Lieutenant\r\n\r\n   Cas. For mine owne part, no offence to the Generall,\r\nnor any man of qualitie: I hope to be saued\r\n\r\n   Iago. And so do I too Lieutenant\r\n\r\n   Cassio. I: (but by your leaue) not before me. The\r\nLieutenant is to be saued before the Ancient. Let's haue\r\nno more of this: let's to our Affaires. Forgiue vs our\r\nsinnes: Gentlemen let's looke to our businesse. Do not\r\nthinke Gentlemen, I am drunke: this is my Ancient, this\r\nis my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunke\r\nnow: I can stand well enough, and I speake well enough\r\n\r\n   Gent. Excellent well\r\n\r\n   Cas. Why very well then: you must not thinke then,\r\nthat I am drunke.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Monta. To th' Platforme (Masters) come, let's set the\r\nWatch\r\n\r\n   Iago. You see this Fellow, that is gone before,\r\nHe's a Souldier, fit to stand by Caesar,\r\nAnd giue direction. And do but see his vice,\r\n'Tis to his vertue, a iust Equinox,\r\nThe one as long as th' other. 'Tis pittie of him:\r\nI feare the trust Othello puts him in,\r\nOn some odde time of his infirmitie\r\nWill shake this Island\r\n\r\n   Mont. But is he often thus?\r\n  Iago. 'Tis euermore his prologue to his sleepe,\r\nHe'le watch the Horologe a double Set,\r\nIf Drinke rocke not his Cradle\r\n\r\n   Mont. It were well\r\nThe Generall were put in mind of it:\r\nPerhaps he sees it not, or his good nature\r\nPrizes the vertue that appeares in Cassio,\r\nAnd lookes not on his euills: is not this true?\r\nEnter Rodorigo.\r\n\r\n  Iago. How now Rodorigo?\r\nI pray you after the Lieutenant, go\r\n\r\n   Mon. And 'tis great pitty, that the Noble Moore\r\nShould hazard such a Place, as his owne Second\r\nWith one of an ingraft Infirmitie,\r\nIt were an honest Action, to say so\r\nTo the Moore\r\n\r\n   Iago. Not I, for this faire Island,\r\nI do loue Cassio well: and would do much\r\nTo cure him of this euill, But hearke, what noise?\r\nEnter Cassio pursuing Rodorigo.\r\n\r\n  Cas. You Rogue: you Rascall\r\n\r\n   Mon. What's the matter Lieutenant?\r\n  Cas. A Knaue teach me my dutie? Ile beate the\r\nKnaue in to a Twiggen-Bottle\r\n\r\n   Rod. Beate me?\r\n  Cas. Dost thou prate, Rogue?\r\n  Mon. Nay, good Lieutenant:\r\nI pray you Sir, hold your hand\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Let me go (Sir)\r\nOr Ile knocke you o're the Mazard\r\n\r\n   Mon. Come, come: you're drunke\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Drunke?\r\n  Iago. Away I say: go out and cry a Mutinie.\r\nNay good Lieutenant. Alas Gentlemen:\r\nHelpe hoa. Lieutenant. Sir Montano:\r\nHelpe Masters. Heere's a goodly Watch indeed.\r\nWho's that which rings the Bell: Diablo, hoa:\r\nThe Towne will rise. Fie, fie Lieutenant,\r\nYou'le be asham'd for euer.\r\nEnter Othello, and Attendants.\r\n\r\n  Othe. What is the matter heere?\r\n  Mon. I bleed still, I am hurt to th' death. He dies\r\n\r\n   Othe. Hold for your liues\r\n\r\n   Iag. Hold hoa: Lieutenant, Sir Montano, Gentlemen:\r\nHaue you forgot all place of sense and dutie?\r\nHold. The Generall speaks to you: hold for shame\r\n\r\n   Oth. Why how now hoa? From whence ariseth this?\r\nAre we turn'd Turkes? and to our selues do that\r\nWhich Heauen hath forbid the Ottamittes.\r\nFor Christian shame, put by this barbarous Brawle:\r\nHe that stirs next, to carue for his owne rage,\r\nHolds his soule light: He dies vpon his Motion.\r\nSilence that dreadfull Bell, it frights the Isle,\r\nFrom her propriety. What is the matter, Masters?\r\nHonest Iago, that lookes dead with greeuing,\r\nSpeake: who began this? On thy loue I charge thee?\r\n  Iago. I do not know: Friends all, but now, euen now.\r\nIn Quarter, and in termes like Bride, and Groome\r\nDeuesting them for Bed: and then, but now:\r\n(As if some Planet had vnwitted men)\r\nSwords out, and tilting one at others breastes,\r\nIn opposition bloody. I cannot speake\r\nAny begining to this peeuish oddes.\r\nAnd would, in Action glorious, I had lost\r\nThose legges, that brought me to a part of it\r\n\r\n   Othe. How comes it (Michaell) you are thus forgot?\r\n  Cas. I pray you pardon me, I cannot speake\r\n\r\n   Othe. Worthy Montano, you were wont to be ciuill:\r\nThe grauitie, and stillnesse of your youth\r\nThe world hath noted. And your name is great\r\nIn mouthes of wisest Censure. What's the matter\r\nThat you vnlace your reputation thus,\r\nAnd spend your rich opinion, for the name\r\nOf a night-brawler? Giue me answer to it\r\n\r\n   Mon. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger,\r\nYour Officer Iago, can informe you,\r\nWhile I spare speech which something now offends me.\r\nOf all that I do know, nor know I ought\r\nBy me, that's said, or done amisse this night,\r\nVnlesse selfe-charitie be sometimes a vice,\r\nAnd to defend our selues, it be a sinne\r\nWhen violence assailes vs\r\n\r\n   Othe. Now by Heauen,\r\nMy blood begins my safer Guides to rule,\r\nAnd passion (hauing my best iudgement collied)\r\nAssaies to leade the way. If I once stir,\r\nOr do but lift this Arme, the best of you\r\nShall sinke in my rebuke. Giue me to know\r\nHow this foule Rout began: Who set it on,\r\nAnd he that is approu'd in this offence,\r\nThough he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,\r\nShall loose me. What in a Towne of warre,\r\nYet wilde, the peoples hearts brim-full of feare,\r\nTo Manage priuate, and domesticke Quarrell?\r\nIn night, and on the Court and Guard of safetie?\r\n'Tis monstrous: Iago, who began't?\r\n  Mon. If partially Affin'd, or league in office,\r\nThou dost deliuer more, or lesse then Truth,\r\nThou art no Souldier\r\n\r\n   Iago. Touch me not so neere,\r\nI had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth,\r\nThen it should do offence to Michaell Cassio.\r\nYet I perswade my selfe, to speake the truth\r\nShall nothing wrong him. This it is Generall:\r\nMontano and my selfe being in speech,\r\nThere comes a Fellow, crying out for helpe,\r\nAnd Cassio following him with determin'd Sword\r\nTo execute vpon him. Sir, this Gentleman,\r\nSteppes in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:\r\nMy selfe, the crying Fellow did pursue,\r\nLeast by his clamour (as it so fell out)\r\nThe Towne might fall in fright. He, (swift of foote)\r\nOut-ran my purpose: and I return'd then rather\r\nFor that I heard the clinke, and fall of Swords,\r\nAnd Cassio high in oath: Which till to night\r\nI nere might say before. When I came backe\r\n(For this was briefe) I found them close together\r\nAt blow, and thrust, euen as againe they were\r\nWhen you your selfe did part them.\r\nMore of this matter cannot I report,\r\nBut Men are Men: The best sometimes forget,\r\nThough Cassio did some little wrong to him,\r\nAs men in rage strike those that wish them best,\r\nYet surely Cassio, I beleeue receiu'd\r\nFrom him that fled, some strange Indignitie,\r\nWhich patience could not passe\r\n\r\n   Othe. I know Iago\r\nThy honestie, and loue doth mince this matter,\r\nMaking it light to Cassio: Cassio, I loue thee,\r\nBut neuer more be Officer of mine.\r\nEnter Desdemona attended.\r\n\r\nLooke if my gentle Loue be not rais'd vp:\r\nIle make thee an example\r\n\r\n   Des. What is the matter (Deere?)\r\n  Othe. All's well, Sweeting:\r\nCome away to bed. Sir for your hurts,\r\nMy selfe will be your Surgeon. Lead him off:\r\nIago, looke with care about the Towne,\r\nAnd silence those whom this vil'd brawle distracted.\r\nCome Desdemona, 'tis the Soldiers life,\r\nTo haue their Balmy slumbers wak'd with strife.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Iago. What are you hurt Lieutenant?\r\n  Cas. I, past all Surgery\r\n\r\n   Iago. Marry Heauen forbid\r\n\r\n   Cas. Reputation, Reputation, Reputation: Oh I haue\r\nlost my Reputation. I haue lost the immortall part of\r\nmyselfe, and what remaines is bestiall. My Reputation,\r\nIago, my Reputation\r\n\r\n   Iago. As I am an honest man I had thought you had\r\nreceiued some bodily wound; there is more sence in that\r\nthen in Reputation. Reputation is an idle, and most false\r\nimposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deseruing.\r\nYou haue lost no Reputation at all, vnlesse you\r\nrepute your selfe such a looser. What man, there are\r\nmore wayes to recouer the Generall againe. You are\r\nbut now cast in his moode, (a punishment more in policie,\r\nthen in malice) euen so as one would beate his offencelesse\r\ndogge, to affright an Imperious Lyon. Sue to\r\nhim againe, and he's yours\r\n\r\n   Cas. I will rather sue to be despis'd, then to deceiue\r\nso good a Commander, with so slight, so drunken, and so\r\nindiscreet an Officer. Drunke? And speake Parrat? And\r\nsquabble? Swagger? Sweare? And discourse Fustian\r\nwith ones owne shadow? Oh thou invisible spirit of\r\nWine, if thou hast no name to be knowne by, let vs call\r\nthee Diuell\r\n\r\n   Iago. What was he that you follow'd with your\r\nSword? What had he done to you?\r\n  Cas. I know not\r\n\r\n   Iago. Is't possible?\r\n  Cas. I remember a masse of things, but nothing distinctly:\r\na Quarrell, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that\r\nmen should put an Enemie in their mouthes, to steale away\r\ntheir Braines? that we should with ioy, pleasance,\r\nreuell and applause, transforme our selues into Beasts\r\n\r\n   Iago. Why? But you are now well enough: how\r\ncame you thus recouered?\r\n  Cas. It hath pleas'd the diuell drunkennesse, to giue\r\nplace to the diuell wrath, one vnperfectnesse, shewes me\r\nanother to make me frankly despise my selfe\r\n\r\n   Iago. Come, you are too seuere a Moraller. As the\r\nTime, the Place, & the Condition of this Country stands\r\nI could hartily wish this had not befalne: but since it is, as\r\nit is, mend it for your owne good\r\n\r\n   Cas. I will aske him for my Place againe, he shall tell\r\nme, I am a drunkard: had I as many mouthes as Hydra,\r\nsuch an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible\r\nman, by and by a Foole, and presently a Beast. Oh\r\nstrange! Euery inordinate cup is vnbless'd, and the Ingredient\r\nis a diuell\r\n\r\n   Iago. Come, come: good wine, is a good familiar\r\nCreature, if it be well vs'd: exclaime no more against it.\r\nAnd good Lieutenant, I thinke, you thinke I loue\r\nyou\r\n\r\n   Cassio. I haue well approued it, Sir. I drunke?\r\n  Iago. You, or any man liuing, may be drunke at a\r\ntime man. I tell you what you shall do: Our General's\r\nWife, is now the Generall. I may say so, in this respect,\r\nfor that he hath deuoted, and giuen vp himselfe to the\r\nContemplation, marke: and deuotement of her parts\r\nand Graces. Confesse your selfe freely to her: Importune\r\nher helpe to put you in your place againe. She is\r\nof so free, so kinde, so apt, so blessed a disposition,\r\nshe holds it a vice in her goodnesse, not to do more\r\nthen she is requested. This broken ioynt betweene\r\nyou, and her husband, entreat her to splinter. And my\r\nFortunes against any lay worth naming, this cracke of\r\nyour Loue, shall grow stronger, then it was before\r\n\r\n   Cassio. You aduise me well\r\n\r\n   Iago. I protest in the sinceritie of Loue, and honest\r\nkindnesse\r\n\r\n   Cassio. I thinke it freely: and betimes in the morning,\r\nI will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake\r\nfor me: I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me\r\n\r\n   Iago. You are in the right: good night Lieutenant, I\r\nmust to the Watch\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Good night, honest Iago.\r\n\r\nExit Cassio.\r\n\r\n  Iago. And what's he then,\r\nThat saies I play the Villaine?\r\nWhen this aduise is free I giue, and honest,\r\nProball to thinking, and indeed the course\r\nTo win the Moore againe.\r\nFor 'tis most easie\r\nTh' inclyning Desdemona to subdue\r\nIn any honest Suite. She's fram'd as fruitefull\r\nAs the free Elements. And then for her\r\nTo win the Moore, were to renownce his Baptisme,\r\nAll Seales, and Simbols of redeemed sin:\r\nHis Soule is so enfetter'd to her Loue,\r\nThat she may make, vnmake, do what she list,\r\nEuen as her Appetite shall play the God,\r\nWith his weake Function. How am I then a Villaine,\r\nTo Counsell Cassio to this paralell course,\r\nDirectly to his good? Diuinitie of hell,\r\nWhen diuels will the blackest sinnes put on,\r\nThey do suggest at first with heauenly shewes,\r\nAs I do now. For whiles this honest Foole\r\nPlies Desdemona, to repaire his Fortune,\r\nAnd she for him, pleades strongly to the Moore,\r\nIle powre this pestilence into his eare:\r\nThat she repeales him, for her bodies Lust,\r\nAnd by how much she striues to do him good,\r\nShe shall vndo her Credite with the Moore.\r\nSo will I turne her vertue into pitch.\r\nAnd out of her owne goodnesse make the Net,\r\nThat shall en-mash them all.\r\nHow now Rodorigo?\r\nEnter Rodorigo.\r\n\r\n  Rodorigo. I do follow heere in the Chace, not\r\nlike a Hound that hunts, but one that filles vp the\r\nCrie. My Money is almost spent; I haue bin to night\r\nexceedingly well Cudgell'd: And I thinke the issue\r\nwill bee, I shall haue so much experience for my paines;\r\nAnd so, with no money at all, and a little more Wit, returne\r\nagaine to Venice\r\n\r\n   Iago. How poore are they that haue not Patience?\r\nWhat wound did euer heale but by degrees?\r\nThou know'st we worke by Wit, and not by Witchcraft\r\nAnd Wit depends on dilatory time:\r\nDos't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,\r\nAnd thou by that small hurt hath casheer'd Cassio:\r\nThough other things grow faire against the Sun,\r\nYet Fruites that blossome first, will first be ripe:\r\nContent thy selfe, a-while. Introth 'tis Morning;\r\nPleasure, and Action, make the houres seeme short.\r\nRetire thee, go where thou art Billited:\r\nAway, I say, thou shalt know more heereafter:\r\nNay get thee gone.\r\n\r\nExit Roderigo.\r\n\r\nTwo things are to be done:\r\nMy Wife must moue for Cassio to her Mistris:\r\nIle set her on my selfe, a while, to draw the Moor apart,\r\nAnd bring him iumpe, when he may Cassio finde\r\nSoliciting his wife: I, that's the way:\r\nDull not Deuice, by coldnesse, and delay.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n\r\nActus Tertius. Scena Prima.\r\n\r\nEnter Cassio, Musitians, and Clowne.\r\n\r\n  Cassio. Masters, play heere, I wil content your paines,\r\nSomething that's briefe: and bid, goodmorrow General\r\n\r\n   Clo. Why Masters, haue your Instruments bin in Naples,\r\nthat they speake i'th' Nose thus?\r\n  Mus. How Sir? how?\r\n  Clo. Are these I pray you, winde Instruments?\r\n  Mus. I marry are they sir\r\n\r\n   Clo. Oh, thereby hangs a tale\r\n\r\n   Mus. Whereby hangs a tale, sir?\r\n  Clow. Marry sir, by many a winde Instrument that I\r\nknow. But Masters, heere's money for you: and the Generall\r\nso likes your Musick, that he desires you for loues\r\nsake to make no more noise with it\r\n\r\n   Mus. Well Sir, we will not\r\n\r\n   Clo. If you haue any Musicke that may not be heard,\r\ntoo't againe. But (as they say) to heare Musicke, the Generall\r\ndo's not greatly care\r\n\r\n   Mus. We haue none such, sir\r\n\r\n   Clow. Then put vp your Pipes in your bagge, for Ile\r\naway. Go, vanish into ayre, away.\r\n\r\nExit Mu.\r\n\r\n  Cassio. Dost thou heare me, mine honest Friend?\r\n  Clo. No, I heare not your honest Friend:\r\nI heare you\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Prythee keepe vp thy Quillets, ther's a poore\r\npeece of Gold for thee: if the Gentlewoman that attends\r\nthe Generall be stirring, tell her, there's one Cassio entreats\r\nher a little fauour of Speech. Wilt thou do this?\r\n  Clo. She is stirring sir: if she will stirre hither, I shall\r\nseeme to notifie vnto her.\r\n\r\nExit Clo.\r\n\r\nEnter Iago.\r\n\r\nIn happy time, Iago\r\n\r\n   Iago. You haue not bin a-bed then?\r\n  Cassio. Why no: the day had broke before we parted.\r\nI haue made bold (Iago) to send in to your wife:\r\nMy suite to her is, that she will to vertuous Desdemona\r\nProcure me some accesse\r\n\r\n   Iago. Ile send her to you presently:\r\nAnd Ile deuise a meane to draw the Moore\r\nOut of the way, that your conuerse and businesse\r\nMay be more free.\r\n\r\nExit\r\n\r\n  Cassio. I humbly thanke you for't. I neuer knew\r\nA Florentine more kinde, and honest.\r\nEnter aemilia.\r\n\r\nAemil. Goodmorrow (good Lieutenant) I am sorrie\r\nFor your displeasure: but all will sure be well.\r\nThe Generall and his wife are talking of it,\r\nAnd she speakes for you stoutly. The Moore replies,\r\nThat he you hurt is of great Fame in Cyprus,\r\nAnd great Affinitie: and that in wholsome Wisedome\r\nHe might not but refuse you. But he protests he loues you\r\nAnd needs no other Suitor, but his likings\r\nTo bring you in againe\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Yet I beseech you,\r\nIf you thinke fit, or that it may be done,\r\nGiue me aduantage of some breefe Discourse\r\nWith Desdemon alone.\r\nAemil. Pray you come in:\r\nI will bestow you where you shall haue time\r\nTo speake your bosome freely\r\n\r\n   Cassio. I am much bound to you.\r\n\r\nScoena Secunda.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.\r\n\r\n  Othe. These Letters giue (Iago) to the Pylot,\r\nAnd by him do my duties to the Senate:\r\nThat done, I will be walking on the Workes,\r\nRepaire there to mee\r\n\r\n   Iago. Well, my good Lord, Ile doo't\r\n\r\n   Oth. This Fortification (Gentlemen) shall we see't?\r\n  Gent. Well waite vpon your Lordship.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nScoena Tertia.\r\n\r\nEnter Desdemona, Cassio, and aemilia.\r\n\r\n  Des. Be thou assur'd (good Cassio) I will do\r\nAll my abilities in thy behalfe.\r\nAemil. Good Madam do:\r\nI warrant it greeues my Husband,\r\nAs if the cause were his\r\n\r\n   Des. Oh that's an honest Fellow, Do not doubt Cassio\r\nBut I will haue my Lord, and you againe\r\nAs friendly as you were\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Bounteous Madam,\r\nWhat euer shall become of Michael Cassio,\r\nHe's neuer any thing but your true Seruant\r\n\r\n   Des. I know't: I thanke you: you do loue my Lord:\r\nYou haue knowne him long, and be you well assur'd\r\nHe shall in strangenesse stand no farther off,\r\nThen in a politique distance\r\n\r\n   Cassio. I, but Lady,\r\nThat policie may either last so long,\r\nOr feede vpon such nice and waterish diet,\r\nOr breede it selfe so out of Circumstances,\r\nThat I being absent, and my place supply'd,\r\nMy Generall will forget my Loue, and Seruice\r\n\r\n   Des. Do not doubt that: before aemilia here,\r\nI giue thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,\r\nIf I do vow a friendship, Ile performe it\r\nTo the last Article. My Lord shall neuer rest,\r\nIle watch him tame, and talke him out of patience;\r\nHis Bed shall seeme a Schoole, his Boord a Shrift,\r\nIle intermingle euery thing he do's\r\nWith Cassio's suite: Therefore be merry Cassio,\r\nFor thy Solicitor shall rather dye,\r\nThen giue thy cause away.\r\nEnter Othello, and Iago.\r\n\r\nAemil. Madam, heere comes my Lord\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Madam, Ile take my leaue\r\n\r\n   Des. Why stay, and heare me speake\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,\r\nVnfit for mine owne purposes\r\n\r\n   Des. Well, do your discretion.\r\n\r\nExit Cassio.\r\n\r\n  Iago. Hah? I like not that\r\n\r\n   Othel. What dost thou say?\r\n  Iago. Nothing my Lord; or if- I know not what\r\n\r\n   Othel. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?\r\n  Iago. Cassio my Lord? No sure, I cannot thinke it\r\nThat he would steale away so guilty-like,\r\nSeeing your comming\r\n\r\n   Oth. I do beleeue 'twas he\r\n\r\n   Des. How now my Lord?\r\nI haue bin talking with a Suitor heere,\r\nA man that languishes in your displeasure\r\n\r\n   Oth. Who is't you meane?\r\n  Des. Why your Lieutenant Cassio: Good my Lord,\r\nIf I haue any grace, or power to moue you,\r\nHis present reconciliation take.\r\nFor if he be not one, that truly loues you,\r\nThat erres in Ignorance, and not in Cunning,\r\nI haue no iudgement in an honest face.\r\nI prythee call him backe\r\n\r\n   Oth. Went he hence now?\r\n  Des. I sooth; so humbled,\r\nThat he hath left part of his greefe with mee\r\nTo suffer with him. Good Loue, call him backe\r\n\r\n   Othel. Not now (sweet Desdemon) some other time\r\n\r\n   Des. But shall't be shortly?\r\n  Oth. The sooner (Sweet) for you\r\n\r\n   Des. Shall't be to night, at Supper?\r\n  Oth. No, not to night\r\n\r\n   Des. To morrow Dinner then?\r\n  Oth. I shall not dine at home:\r\nI meete the Captaines at the Cittadell\r\n\r\n   Des. Why then to morrow night, on Tuesday morne,\r\nOn Tuesday noone, or night; on Wensday Morne.\r\nI prythee name the time, but let it not\r\nExceed three dayes. Infaith hee's penitent:\r\nAnd yet his Trespasse, in our common reason\r\n(Saue that they say the warres must make example)\r\nOut of her best, is not almost a fault\r\nT' encurre a priuate checke. When shall he come?\r\nTell me Othello. I wonder in my Soule\r\nWhat you would aske me, that I should deny,\r\nOr stand so mam'ring on? What? Michael Cassio,\r\nThat came a woing with you? and so many a time\r\n(When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly)\r\nHath tane your part, to haue so much to do\r\nTo bring him in? Trust me, I could do much\r\n\r\n   Oth. Prythee no more: Let him come when he will:\r\nI will deny thee nothing\r\n\r\n   Des. Why, this is not a Boone:\r\n'Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues,\r\nOr feede on nourishing dishes, or keepe you warme,\r\nOr sue to you, to do a peculiar profit\r\nTo your owne person. Nay, when I haue a suite\r\nWherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed,\r\nIt shall be full of poize, and difficult waight,\r\nAnd fearefull to be granted\r\n\r\n   Oth. I will deny thee nothing.\r\nWhereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,\r\nTo leaue me but a little to my selfe\r\n\r\n   Des. Shall I deny you? No: farewell my Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. Farewell my Desdemona, Ile come to thee strait\r\n\r\n   Des. aemilia come; be as your Fancies teach you:\r\nWhat ere you be, I am obedient.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Oth. Excellent wretch: Perdition catch my Soule\r\nBut I do loue thee: and when I loue thee not,\r\nChaos is come againe\r\n\r\n   Iago. My Noble Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. What dost thou say, Iago?\r\n  Iago. Did Michael Cassio\r\nWhen he woo'd my Lady, know of your loue?\r\n  Oth. He did, from first to last:\r\nWhy dost thou aske?\r\n  Iago. But for a satisfaction of my Thought,\r\nNo further harme\r\n\r\n   Oth. Why of thy thought, Iago?\r\n  Iago. I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir\r\n\r\n   Oth. O yes, and went betweene vs very oft\r\n\r\n   Iago. Indeed?\r\n  Oth. Indeed? I indeed. Discern'st thou ought in that?\r\nIs he not honest?\r\n  Iago. Honest, my Lord?\r\n  Oth. Honest? I, Honest\r\n\r\n   Iago. My Lord, for ought I know\r\n\r\n   Oth. What do'st thou thinke?\r\n  Iago. Thinke, my Lord?\r\n  Oth. Thinke, my Lord? Alas, thou ecchos't me;\r\nAs if there were some Monster in thy thought\r\nToo hideous to be shewne. Thou dost mean somthing:\r\nI heard thee say euen now, thou lik'st not that,\r\nWhen Cassio left my wife. What didd'st not like?\r\nAnd when I told thee, he was of my Counsaile,\r\nOf my whole course of wooing; thou cried'st, Indeede?\r\nAnd didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together,\r\nAs if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine\r\nSome horrible Conceite. If thou do'st loue me,\r\nShew me thy thought\r\n\r\n   Iago. My Lord, you know I loue you\r\n\r\n   Oth. I thinke thou do'st:\r\nAnd for I know thou'rt full of Loue, and Honestie,\r\nAnd weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,\r\nTherefore these stops of thine, fright me the more:\r\nFor such things in a false disloyall Knaue\r\nAre trickes of Custome: but in a man that's iust,\r\nThey're close dilations, working from the heart,\r\nThat Passion cannot rule\r\n\r\n   Iago. For Michael Cassio,\r\nI dare be sworne, I thinke that he is honest\r\n\r\n   Oth. I thinke so too\r\n\r\n   Iago. Men should be what they seeme,\r\nOr those that be not, would they might seeme none\r\n\r\n   Oth. Certaine, men should be what they seeme\r\n\r\n   Iago. Why then I thinke Cassio's an honest man\r\n\r\n   Oth. Nay, yet there's more in this?\r\nI prythee speake to me, as to thy thinkings,\r\nAs thou dost ruminate, and giue thy worst of thoughts\r\nThe worst of words\r\n\r\n   Iago. Good my Lord pardon me,\r\nThough I am bound to euery Acte of dutie,\r\nI am not bound to that: All Slaues are free:\r\nVtter my Thoughts? Why say, they are vild, and falce?\r\nAs where's that Palace, whereinto foule things\r\nSometimes intrude not? Who ha's that breast so pure,\r\nWherein vncleanly Apprehensions\r\nKeepe Leetes, and Law-dayes, and in Sessions sit\r\nWith meditations lawfull?\r\n  Oth. Thou do'st conspire against thy Friend (Iago)\r\nIf thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his eare\r\nA stranger to thy Thoughts\r\n\r\n   Iago. I do beseech you,\r\nThough I perchance am vicious in my guesse\r\n(As I confesse it is my Natures plague\r\nTo spy into Abuses, and of my iealousie\r\nShapes faults that are not) that your wisedome\r\nFrom one, that so imperfectly conceits,\r\nWould take no notice, nor build your selfe a trouble\r\nOut of his scattering, and vnsure obseruance:\r\nIt were not for your quiet, nor your good,\r\nNor for my Manhood, Honesty, and Wisedome,\r\nTo let you know my thoughts\r\n\r\n   Oth. What dost thou meane?\r\n  Iago. Good name in Man, & woman (deere my Lord)\r\nIs the immediate Iewell of their Soules;\r\nWho steales my purse, steales trash:\r\n'Tis something, nothing;\r\n'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has bin slaue to thousands:\r\nBut he that filches from me my good Name,\r\nRobs me of that, which not enriches him,\r\nAnd makes me poore indeed\r\n\r\n   Oth. Ile know thy Thoughts\r\n\r\n   Iago. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,\r\nNor shall not, whil'st 'tis in my custodie\r\n\r\n   Oth. Ha?\r\n  Iago. Oh, beware my Lord, of iealousie,\r\nIt is the greene-ey'd Monster, which doth mocke\r\nThe meate it feeds on. That Cuckold liues in blisse,\r\nWho certaine of his Fate, loues not his wronger:\r\nBut oh, what damned minutes tels he ore,\r\nWho dotes, yet doubts: Suspects, yet soundly loues?\r\n  Oth. O miserie\r\n\r\n   Iago. Poore, and Content, is rich, and rich enough,\r\nBut Riches finelesse, is as poore as Winter,\r\nTo him that euer feares he shall be poore:\r\nGood Heauen, the Soules of all my Tribe defend\r\nFrom Iealousie\r\n\r\n   Oth. Why? why is this?\r\nThink'st thou, I'ld make a Life of Iealousie;\r\nTo follow still the changes of the Moone\r\nWith fresh suspitions? No: to be once in doubt,\r\nIs to be resolu'd: Exchange me for a Goat,\r\nWhen I shall turne the businesse of my Soule\r\nTo such exufflicate, and blow'd Surmises,\r\nMatching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me Iealious,\r\nTo say my wife is faire, feeds well, loues company,\r\nIs free of Speech, Sings, Playes, and Dances:\r\nWhere Vertue is, these are more vertuous.\r\nNor from mine owne weake merites, will I draw\r\nThe smallest feare, or doubt of her reuolt,\r\nFor she had eyes, and chose me. No Iago,\r\nIle see before I doubt; when I doubt, proue;\r\nAnd on the proofe, there is no more but this,\r\nAway at once with Loue, or Iealousie\r\n\r\n   Ia. I am glad of this: For now I shall haue reason\r\nTo shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you\r\nWith franker spirit. Therefore (as I am bound)\r\nReceiue it from me. I speake not yet of proofe:\r\nLooke to your wife, obserue her well with Cassio,\r\nWeare your eyes, thus: not Iealious, nor Secure:\r\nI would not haue your free, and Noble Nature,\r\nOut of selfe-Bounty, be abus'd: Looke too't:\r\nI know our Country disposition well:\r\nIn Venice, they do let Heauen see the prankes\r\nThey dare not shew their Husbands.\r\nTheir best Conscience,\r\nIs not to leaue't vndone, but kept vnknowne\r\n\r\n   Oth. Dost thou say so?\r\n  Iago. She did deceiue her Father, marrying you,\r\nAnd when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes,\r\nShe lou'd them most\r\n\r\n   Oth. And so she did\r\n\r\n   Iago. Why go too then:\r\nShee that so young could giue out such a Seeming\r\nTo seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake,\r\nHe thought 'twas Witchcraft.\r\nBut I am much too blame:\r\nI humbly do beseech you of your pardon\r\nFor too much louing you\r\n\r\n   Oth. I am bound to thee for euer\r\n\r\n   Iago. I see this hath a little dash'd your Spirits:\r\n  Oth. Not a iot, not a iot\r\n\r\n   Iago. Trust me, I feare it has:\r\nI hope you will consider what is spoke\r\nComes from your Loue.\r\nBut I do see y'are moou'd:\r\nI am to pray you, not to straine my speech\r\nTo grosser issues, nor to larger reach,\r\nThen to Suspition\r\n\r\n   Oth. I will not\r\n\r\n   Iago. Should you do so (my Lord)\r\nMy speech should fall into such vilde successe,\r\nWhich my Thoughts aym'd not.\r\nCassio's my worthy Friend:\r\nMy Lord, I see y'are mou'd\r\n\r\n   Oth. No, not much mou'd:\r\nI do not thinke but Desdemona's honest\r\n\r\n   Iago. Long liue she so;\r\nAnd long liue you to thinke so\r\n\r\n   Oth. And yet how Nature erring from it selfe\r\n\r\n   Iago. I, there's the point:\r\nAs (to be bold with you)\r\nNot to affect many proposed Matches\r\nOf her owne Clime, Complexion, and Degree,\r\nWhereto we see in all things, Nature tends:\r\nFoh, one may smel in such, a will most ranke,\r\nFoule disproportions, Thoughts vnnaturall.\r\nBut (pardon me) I do not in position\r\nDistinctly speake of her, though I may feare\r\nHer will, recoyling to her better iudgement,\r\nMay fal to match you with her Country formes,\r\nAnd happily repent\r\n\r\n   Oth. Farewell, farewell:\r\nIf more thou dost perceiue, let me know more:\r\nSet on thy wife to obserue.\r\nLeaue me Iago\r\n\r\n   Iago. My Lord, I take my leaue\r\n\r\n   Othel. Why did I marry?\r\nThis honest Creature (doubtlesse)\r\nSees, and knowes more, much more then he vnfolds\r\n\r\n   Iago. My Lord, I would I might intreat your Honor\r\nTo scan this thing no farther: Leaue it to time,\r\nAlthough 'tis fit that Cassio haue his Place;\r\nFor sure he filles it vp with great Ability;\r\nYet if you please, to him off a-while:\r\nYou shall by that perceiue him, and his meanes:\r\nNote if your Lady straine his Entertainment\r\nWith any strong, or vehement importunitie,\r\nMuch will be seene in that: In the meane time,\r\nLet me be thought too busie in my feares,\r\n(As worthy cause I haue to feare I am)\r\nAnd hold her free, I do beseech your Honor\r\n\r\n   Oth. Feare not my gouernment\r\n\r\n   Iago. I once more take my leaue.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Oth. This Fellow's of exceeding honesty,\r\nAnd knowes all Quantities with a learn'd Spirit\r\nOf humane dealings. If I do proue her Haggard,\r\nThough that her Iesses were my deere heart-strings,\r\nI'ld whistle her off, and let her downe the winde\r\nTo prey at Fortune. Haply, for I am blacke,\r\nAnd haue not those soft parts of Conuersation\r\nThat Chamberers haue: Or for I am declin'd\r\nInto the vale of yeares (yet that's not much)\r\nShee's gone. I am abus'd, and my releefe\r\nMust be to loath her. Oh Curse of Marriage!\r\nThat we can call these delicate Creatures ours,\r\nAnd not their Appetites? I had rather be a Toad,\r\nAnd liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon,\r\nThen keepe a corner in the thing I loue\r\nFor others vses. Yet 'tis the plague to Great-ones,\r\nPrerogatiu'd are they lesse then the Base,\r\n'Tis destiny vnshunnable, like death:\r\nEuen then, this forked plague is Fated to vs,\r\nWhen we do quicken. Looke where she comes:\r\nEnter Desdemona and aemilia.\r\n\r\nIf she be false, Heauen mock'd it selfe:\r\nIle not beleeue't\r\n\r\n   Des. How now, my deere Othello?\r\nYour dinner, and the generous Islanders\r\nBy you inuited, do attend your presence\r\n\r\n   Oth. I am too blame\r\n\r\n   Des. Why do you speake so faintly?\r\nAre you not well?\r\n  Oth. I haue a paine vpon my Forehead, heere\r\n\r\n   Des. Why that's with watching, 'twill away againe.\r\nLet me but binde it hard, within this houre\r\nIt will be well\r\n\r\n   Oth. Your Napkin is too little:\r\nLet it alone: Come, Ile go in with you.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Des. I am very sorry that you are not well.\r\nAemil. I am glad I haue found this Napkin:\r\nThis was her first remembrance from the Moore,\r\nMy wayward Husband hath a hundred times\r\nWoo'd me to steale it. But she so loues the Token,\r\n(For he coniur'd her, she should euer keepe it)\r\nThat she reserues it euermore about her,\r\nTo kisse, and talke too. Ile haue the worke tane out,\r\nAnd giu't Iago: what he will do with it\r\nHeauen knowes, not I:\r\nI nothing, but to please his Fantasie.\r\nEnter Iago.\r\n\r\n  Iago. How now? What do you heere alone?\r\nAemil. Do not you chide: I haue a thing for you\r\n\r\n   Iago. You haue a thing for me?\r\nIt is a common thing-\r\nAemil. Hah?\r\n  Iago. To haue a foolish wife.\r\nAemil. Oh, is that all? What will you giue me now\r\nFor that same Handkerchiefe\r\n\r\n   Iago. What Handkerchiefe?\r\nAemil. What Handkerchiefe?\r\nWhy that the Moore first gaue to Desdemona,\r\nThat which so often you did bid me steale\r\n\r\n   Iago. Hast stolne it from her?\r\nAemil. No: but she let it drop by negligence,\r\nAnd to th' aduantage, I being heere, took't vp:\r\nLooke, heere 'tis\r\n\r\n   Iago. A good wench, giue it me.\r\nAemil. What will you do with't, that you haue bene\r\nso earnest to haue me filch it?\r\n  Iago. Why, what is that to you?\r\nAemil. If it be not for some purpose of import,\r\nGiu't me againe. Poore Lady, shee'l run mad\r\nWhen she shall lacke it\r\n\r\n   Iago. Be not acknowne on't:\r\nI haue vse for it. Go, leaue me.\r\n\r\nExit aemil.\r\n\r\nI will in Cassio's Lodging loose this Napkin,\r\nAnd let him finde it. Trifles light as ayre,\r\nAre to the iealious, confirmations strong,\r\nAs proofes of holy Writ. This may do something.\r\nThe Moore already changes with my poyson:\r\nDangerous conceites, are in their Natures poysons,\r\nWhich at the first are scarse found to distaste:\r\nBut with a little acte vpon the blood,\r\nBurne like the Mines of Sulphure. I did say so.\r\nEnter Othello.\r\n\r\nLooke where he comes: Not Poppy, nor Mandragora,\r\nNor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world\r\nShall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe\r\nWhich thou owd'st yesterday\r\n\r\n   Oth. Ha, ha, false to mee?\r\n  Iago. Why how now Generall? No more of that\r\n\r\n   Oth. Auant, be gone: Thou hast set me on the Racke:\r\nI sweare 'tis better to be much abus'd,\r\nThen but to know't a little\r\n\r\n   Iago. How now, my Lord?\r\n  Oth. What sense had I, in her stolne houres of Lust?\r\nI saw't not, thought it not: it harm'd not me:\r\nI slept the next night well, fed well, was free, and merrie.\r\nI found not Cassio's kisses on her Lippes:\r\nHe that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolne,\r\nLet him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all\r\n\r\n   Iago. I am sorry to heare this?\r\n  Oth. I had beene happy, if the generall Campe,\r\nPyoners and all, had tasted her sweet Body,\r\nSo I had nothing knowne. Oh now, for euer\r\nFarewell the Tranquill minde; farewell Content;\r\nFarewell the plumed Troopes, and the bigge Warres,\r\nThat makes Ambition, Vertue! Oh farewell,\r\nFarewell the neighing Steed, and the shrill Trumpe,\r\nThe Spirit-stirring Drum, th' Eare-piercing Fife,\r\nThe Royall Banner, and all Qualitie,\r\nPride, Pompe, and Circumstance of glorious Warre:\r\nAnd O you mortall Engines, whose rude throates\r\nTh' immortall Ioues dread Clamours, counterfet,\r\nFarewell: Othello's Occupation's gone\r\n\r\n   Iago. Is't possible my Lord?\r\n  Oth. Villaine, be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore;\r\nBe sure of it: Giue me the Occular proofe,\r\nOr by the worth of mine eternall Soule,\r\nThou had'st bin better haue bin borne a Dog\r\nThen answer my wak'd wrath\r\n\r\n   Iago. Is't come to this?\r\n  Oth. Make me to see't: or (at the least) so proue it,\r\nThat the probation beare no Hindge, nor Loope,\r\nTo hang a doubt on: Or woe vpon thy life\r\n\r\n   Iago. My Noble Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. If thou dost slander her, and torture me,\r\nNeuer pray more: Abandon all remorse\r\nOn Horrors head, Horrors accumulate:\r\nDo deeds to make Heauen weepe, all Earth amaz'd;\r\nFor nothing canst thou to damnation adde,\r\nGreater then that\r\n\r\n   Iago. O Grace! O Heauen forgiue me!\r\nAre you a Man? Haue you a Soule? or Sense?\r\nGod buy you: take mine Office. Oh wretched Foole,\r\nThat lou'st to make thine Honesty, a Vice!\r\nOh monstrous world! Take note, take note (O World)\r\nTo be direct and honest, is not safe.\r\nI thanke you for this profit, and from hence\r\nIle loue no Friend, sith Loue breeds such offence\r\n\r\n   Oth. Nay stay: thou should'st be honest\r\n\r\n   Iago. I should be wise; for Honestie's a Foole,\r\nAnd looses that it workes for\r\n\r\n   Oth. By the World,\r\nI thinke my Wife be honest, and thinke she is not:\r\nI thinke that thou art iust, and thinke thou art not:\r\nIle haue some proofe. My name that was as fresh\r\nAs Dians Visage, is now begrim'd and blacke\r\nAs mine owne face. If there be Cords, or Kniues,\r\nPoyson, or Fire, or suffocating streames,\r\nIle not indure it. Would I were satisfied\r\n\r\n   Iago. I see you are eaten vp with Passion:\r\nI do repent me, that I put it to you.\r\nYou would be satisfied?\r\n  Oth. Would? Nay, and I will\r\n\r\n   Iago. And may: but how? How satisfied, my Lord?\r\nWould you the super-vision grossely gape on?\r\nBehold her top'd?\r\n  Oth. Death, and damnation. Oh!\r\n  Iago. It were a tedious difficulty, I thinke,\r\nTo bring them to that Prospect: Damne them then,\r\nIf euer mortall eyes do see them boulster\r\nMore then their owne. What then? How then?\r\nWhat shall I say? Where's Satisfaction?\r\nIt is impossible you should see this,\r\nWere they as prime as Goates, as hot as Monkeyes,\r\nAs salt as Wolues in pride, and Fooles as grosse\r\nAs Ignorance, made drunke. But yet, I say,\r\nIf imputation, and strong circumstances,\r\nWhich leade directly to the doore of Truth,\r\nWill giue you satisfaction, you might haue't\r\n\r\n   Oth. Giue me a liuing reason she's disloyall\r\n\r\n   Iago. I do not like the Office.\r\nBut sith I am entred in this cause so farre\r\n(Prick'd too't by foolish Honesty, and Loue)\r\nI will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,\r\nAnd being troubled with a raging tooth,\r\nI could not sleepe. There are a kinde of men,\r\nSo loose of Soule, that in their sleepes will mutter\r\nTheir Affayres: one of this kinde is Cassio:\r\nIn sleepe I heard him say, sweet Desdemona,\r\nLet vs be wary, let vs hide our Loues,\r\nAnd then (Sir) would he gripe, and wring my hand:\r\nCry, oh sweet Creature: then kisse me hard,\r\nAs if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes,\r\nThat grew vpon my lippes, laid his Leg ore my Thigh,\r\nAnd sigh, and kisse, and then cry cursed Fate,\r\nThat gaue thee to the Moore\r\n\r\n   Oth. O monstrous! monstrous!\r\n  Iago. Nay, this was but his Dreame\r\n\r\n   Oth. But this denoted a fore-gone conclusion,\r\n'Tis a shrew'd doubt, though it be but a Dreame\r\n\r\n   Iago. And this may helpe to thicken other proofes,\r\nThat do demonstrate thinly\r\n\r\n   Oth. Ile teare her all to peeces\r\n\r\n   Iago. Nay yet be wise; yet we see nothing done,\r\nShe may be honest yet: Tell me but this,\r\nHaue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe\r\nSpotted with Strawberries, in your wiues hand?\r\n  Oth. I gaue her such a one: 'twas my first gift\r\n\r\n   Iago. I know not that: but such a Handkerchiefe\r\n(I am sure it was your wiues) did I to day\r\nSee Cassio wipe his Beard with\r\n\r\n   Oth. If it be that\r\n\r\n   Iago. If it be that, or any, it was here.\r\nIt speakes against her with the other proofes\r\n\r\n   Othel. O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues:\r\nOne is too poore, too weake for my reuenge.\r\nNow do I see 'tis true. Looke heere Iago,\r\nAll my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen. 'Tis gone.\r\nArise blacke vengeance, from the hollow hell,\r\nYeeld vp (O Loue) thy Crowne, and hearted Throne\r\nTo tyrannous Hate. Swell bosome with thy fraught,\r\nFor 'tis of Aspickes tongues\r\n\r\n   Iago. Yet be content\r\n\r\n   Oth. Oh blood, blood, blood\r\n\r\n   Iago. Patience I say: your minde may change\r\n\r\n   Oth. Neuer Iago. Like to the Ponticke Sea,\r\nWhose Icie Current, and compulsiue course,\r\nNeu'r keepes retyring ebbe, but keepes due on\r\nTo the Proponticke, and the Hellespont:\r\nEuen so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace\r\nShall neu'r looke backe, neu'r ebbe to humble Loue,\r\nTill that a capeable, and wide Reuenge\r\nSwallow them vp. Now by yond Marble Heauen,\r\nIn the due reuerence of a Sacred vow,\r\nI heere engage my words\r\n\r\n   Iago. Do not rise yet:\r\nWitnesse you euer-burning Lights aboue,\r\nYou Elements, that clip vs round about,\r\nWitnesse that heere Iago doth giue vp\r\nThe execution of his wit, hands, heart,\r\nTo wrong'd Othello's Seruice. Let him command,\r\nAnd to obey shall be in me remorse,\r\nWhat bloody businesse euer\r\n\r\n   Oth. I greet thy loue,\r\nNot with vaine thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,\r\nAnd will vpon the instant put thee too't.\r\nWithin these three dayes let me heare thee say,\r\nThat Cassio's not aliue\r\n\r\n   Iago. My Friend is dead:\r\n'Tis done at your Request.\r\nBut let her liue\r\n\r\n   Oth. Damne her lewde Minx:\r\nO damne her, damne her.\r\nCome go with me a-part, I will withdraw\r\nTo furnish me with some swift meanes of death\r\nFor the faire Diuell.\r\nNow art thou my Lieutenant\r\n\r\n   Iago. I am your owne for euer.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScaena Quarta.\r\n\r\nEnter Desdemona, aemilia, and Clown.\r\n\r\n  Des. Do you know Sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio\r\nlyes?\r\n  Clow. I dare not say he lies any where\r\n\r\n   Des. Why man?\r\n  Clo. He's a Soldier, and for me to say a Souldier lyes,\r\n'tis stabbing\r\n\r\n   Des. Go too: where lodges he?\r\n  Clo. To tell you where he lodges, is to tel you where\r\nI lye\r\n\r\n   Des. Can any thing be made of this?\r\n  Clo. I know not where he lodges, and for mee to deuise\r\na lodging, and say he lies heere, or he lies there, were\r\nto lye in mine owne throat\r\n\r\n   Des. Can you enquire him out? and be edified by report?\r\n  Clo. I will Catechize the world for him, that is, make\r\nQuestions, and by them answer\r\n\r\n   Des. Seeke him, bidde him come hither: tell him, I\r\nhaue moou'd my Lord on his behalfe, and hope all will\r\nbe well\r\n\r\n   Clo. To do this, is within the compasse of mans Wit,\r\nand therefore I will attempt the doing it.\r\n\r\nExit Clo.\r\n\r\n  Des. Where should I loose the Handkerchiefe, aemilia?\r\nAemil. I know not Madam\r\n\r\n   Des. Beleeue me, I had rather haue lost my purse\r\nFull of Cruzadoes. And but my Noble Moore\r\nIs true of minde, and made of no such basenesse,\r\nAs iealious Creatures are, it were enough\r\nTo put him to ill-thinking.\r\nAemil. Is he not iealious?\r\n  Des. Who, he? I thinke the Sun where he was borne,\r\nDrew all such humors from him.\r\nAemil. Looke where he comes.\r\nEnter Othello.\r\n\r\n  Des. I will not leaue him now, till Cassio be\r\nCall'd to him. How is't with you, my Lord?\r\n  Oth. Well my good Lady. Oh hardnes to dissemble!\r\nHow do you, Desdemona?\r\n  Des. Well, my good Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. Giue me your hand.\r\nThis hand is moist, my Lady\r\n\r\n   Des. It hath felt no age, nor knowne no sorrow\r\n\r\n   Oth. This argues fruitfulnesse, and liberall heart:\r\nHot, hot, and moyst. This hand of yours requires\r\nA sequester from Liberty: Fasting, and Prayer,\r\nMuch Castigation, Exercise deuout,\r\nFor heere's a yong, and sweating Diuell heere\r\nThat commonly rebels: 'Tis a good hand,\r\nA franke one\r\n\r\n   Des. You may (indeed) say so:\r\nFor 'twas that hand that gaue away my heart\r\n\r\n   Oth. A liberall hand. The hearts of old, gaue hands:\r\nBut our new Heraldry is hands, not hearts\r\n\r\n   Des. I cannot speake of this:\r\nCome, now your promise\r\n\r\n   Oth. What promise, Chucke?\r\n  Des. I haue sent to bid Cassio come speake with you\r\n\r\n   Oth. I haue a salt and sorry Rhewme offends me:\r\nLend me thy Handkerchiefe\r\n\r\n   Des. Heere my Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. That which I gaue you\r\n\r\n   Des. I haue it not about me\r\n\r\n   Oth. Not?\r\n  Des. No indeed, my Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. That's a fault: That Handkerchiefe\r\nDid an aegyptian to my Mother giue:\r\nShe was a Charmer, and could almost read\r\nThe thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,\r\n'T would make her Amiable, and subdue my Father\r\nIntirely to her loue: But if she lost it,\r\nOr made a Guift of it, my Fathers eye\r\nShould hold her loathed, and his Spirits should hunt\r\nAfter new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me,\r\nAnd bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu'd)\r\nTo giue it her. I did so; and take heede on't,\r\nMake it a Darling, like your precious eye:\r\nTo loose't, or giue't away, were such perdition,\r\nAs nothing else could match\r\n\r\n   Des. Is't possible?\r\n  Oth. 'Tis true: There's Magicke in the web of it:\r\nA Sybill that had numbred in the world\r\nThe Sun to course, two hundred compasses,\r\nIn her Prophetticke furie sow'd the Worke:\r\nThe Wormes were hallowed, that did breede the Silke,\r\nAnd it was dyde in Mummey, which the Skilfull\r\nConseru'd of Maidens hearts\r\n\r\n   Des. Indeed? Is't true?\r\n  Oth. Most veritable, therefore looke too't well\r\n\r\n   Des. Then would to Heauen, that I had neuer seene't?\r\n  Oth. Ha? wherefore?\r\n  Des. Why do you speake so startingly, and rash?\r\n  Oth. Is't lost? Is't gon? Speak, is't out o'th' way?\r\n  Des. Blesse vs\r\n\r\n   Oth. Say you?\r\n  Des. It is not lost: but what and if it were?\r\n  Oth. How?\r\n  Des. I say it is not lost\r\n\r\n   Oth. Fetcht, let me see't\r\n\r\n   Des. Why so I can: but I will not now:\r\nThis is a tricke to put me from my suite,\r\nPray you let Cassio be receiu'd againe\r\n\r\n   Oth. Fetch me the Handkerchiefe,\r\nMy minde mis-giues\r\n\r\n   Des. Come, come: you'l neuer meete a more sufficient\r\nman\r\n\r\n   Oth. The Handkerchiefe\r\n\r\n   Des. A man that all his time\r\nHath founded his good Fortunes on your loue;\r\nShar'd dangers with you\r\n\r\n   Oth. The Handkerchiefe\r\n\r\n   Des. Insooth, you are too blame\r\n\r\n   Oth. Away.\r\n\r\nExit Othello.\r\n\r\nAemil. Is not this man iealious?\r\n  Des. I neu'r saw this before.\r\nSure, there's some wonder in this Handkerchiefe,\r\nI am most vnhappy in the losse of it.\r\nAemil. 'Tis not a yeare or two shewes vs a man:\r\nThey are all but Stomackes, and we all but Food,\r\nThey eate vs hungerly, and when they are full\r\nThey belch vs.\r\nEnter Iago, and Cassio.\r\n\r\nLooke you, Cassio and my Husband\r\n\r\n   Iago. There is no other way: 'tis she must doo't:\r\nAnd loe the happinesse: go, and importune her\r\n\r\n   Des. How now (good Cassio) what's the newes with\r\nyou?\r\n  Cassio. Madam, my former suite. I do beseech you,\r\nThat by your vertuous meanes, I may againe\r\nExist, and be a member of his loue,\r\nWhom I, with all the Office of my heart\r\nIntirely honour, I would not be delayd.\r\nIf my offence, be of such mortall kinde,\r\nThat nor my Seruice past, nor present Sorrowes,\r\nNor purpos'd merit in futurity,\r\nCan ransome me into his loue againe,\r\nBut to know so, must be my benefit:\r\nSo shall I cloath me in a forc'd content,\r\nAnd shut my selfe vp in some other course\r\nTo Fortunes Almes\r\n\r\n   Des. Alas (thrice-gentle Cassio)\r\nMy Aduocation is not now in Tune;\r\nMy Lord, is not my Lord; nor should I know him,\r\nWere he in Fauour, as in Humour alter'd.\r\nSo helpe me euery spirit sanctified,\r\nAs I haue spoken for you all my best,\r\nAnd stood within the blanke of his displeasure\r\nFor my free speech. You must awhile be patient:\r\nWhat I can do, I will: and more I will\r\nThen for my selfe, I dare. Let that suffice you\r\n\r\n   Iago. Is my Lord angry?\r\nAemil. He went hence but now:\r\nAnd certainly in strange vnquietnesse\r\n\r\n   Iago. Can he be angry? I haue seen the Cannon\r\nWhen it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre,\r\nAnd like the Diuell from his very Arme\r\nPuff't his owne Brother: And is he angry?\r\nSomething of moment then: I will go meet him,\r\nThere's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.\r\n\r\nExit\r\n\r\n  Des. I prythee do so. Something sure of State,\r\nEither from Venice, or some vnhatch'd practise\r\nMade demonstrable heere in Cyprus, to him,\r\nHath pudled his cleare Spirit: and in such cases,\r\nMens Natures wrangle with inferiour things,\r\nThough great ones are their obiect. 'Tis euen so.\r\nFor let our finger ake, and it endues\r\nOur other healthfull members, euen to a sense\r\nOf paine. Nay, we must thinke men are not Gods,\r\nNor of them looke for such obseruancie\r\nAs fits the Bridall. Beshrew me much, aemilia,\r\nI was (vnhandsome Warrior, as I am)\r\nArraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule:\r\nBut now I finde, I had suborn'd the Witnesse,\r\nAnd he's Indited falsely.\r\nAemil. Pray heauen it bee\r\nState matters, as you thinke, and no Conception,\r\nNor no Iealious Toy, concerning you\r\n\r\n   Des. Alas the day, I neuer gaue him cause.\r\nAemil. But Iealious soules will not be answer'd so;\r\nThey are not euer iealious for the cause,\r\nBut iealious, for they're iealious. It is a Monster\r\nBegot vpon it selfe, borne on it selfe\r\n\r\n   Des. Heauen keepe the Monster from Othello's mind.\r\nAemil. Lady, Amen\r\n\r\n   Des. I will go seeke him. Cassio, walke heere about:\r\nIf I doe finde him fit, Ile moue your suite,\r\nAnd seeke to effect it to my vttermost.\r\n\r\nExit\r\n\r\n  Cas. I humbly thanke your Ladyship.\r\nEnter Bianca.\r\n\r\n  Bian. 'Saue you (Friend Cassio.)\r\n  Cassio. What make you from home?\r\nHow is't with you, my most faire Bianca?\r\nIndeed (sweet Loue) I was comming to your house\r\n\r\n   Bian. And I was going to your Lodging, Cassio.\r\nWhat? keepe a weeke away? Seuen dayes, and Nights?\r\nEight score eight houres? And Louers absent howres\r\nMore tedious then the Diall, eight score times?\r\nOh weary reck'ning\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Pardon me, Bianca:\r\nI haue this while with leaden thoughts beene prest,\r\nBut I shall in a more continuate time\r\nStrike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca\r\nTake me this worke out\r\n\r\n   Bianca. Oh Cassio, whence came this?\r\nThis is some Token from a newer Friend,\r\nTo the felt-Absence: now I feele a Cause:\r\nIs't come to this? Well, well\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Go too, woman:\r\nThrow your vilde gesses in the Diuels teeth,\r\nFrom whence you haue them. You are iealious now,\r\nThat this is from some Mistris, some remembrance;\r\nNo, in good troth Bianca\r\n\r\n   Bian. Why, who's is it?\r\n  Cassio. I know not neither:\r\nI found it in my Chamber,\r\nI like the worke well; Ere it be demanded\r\n(As like enough it will) I would haue it coppied:\r\nTake it, and doo't, and leaue me for this time\r\n\r\n   Bian. Leaue you? Wherefore?\r\n  Cassio. I do attend heere on the Generall,\r\nAnd thinke it no addition, nor my wish\r\nTo haue him see me woman'd\r\n\r\n   Bian. Why, I pray you?\r\n  Cassio. Not that I loue you not\r\n\r\n   Bian. But that you do not loue me.\r\nI pray you bring me on the way a little,\r\nAnd say, if I shall see you soone at night?\r\n  Cassio. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,\r\nFor I attend heere: But Ile see you soone\r\n\r\n   Bian. 'Tis very good: I must be circumstanc'd.\r\n\r\nExeunt. omnes.\r\n\r\n\r\nActus Quartus. Scena Prima.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello, and Iago.\r\n\r\n  Iago. Will you thinke so?\r\n  Oth. Thinke so, Iago?\r\n  Iago. What, to kisse in priuate?\r\n  Oth. An vnauthoriz'd kisse?\r\n  Iago. Or to be naked with her Friend in bed,\r\nAn houre, or more, not meaning any harme?\r\n  Oth. Naked in bed (Iago) and not meane harme?\r\nIt is hypocrisie against the Diuell:\r\nThey that meane vertuously, and yet do so,\r\nThe Diuell their vertue tempts, and they tempt Heauen\r\n\r\n   Iago. If they do nothing, 'tis a Veniall slip:\r\nBut if I giue my wife a Handkerchiefe\r\n\r\n   Oth. What then?\r\n  Iago. Why then 'tis hers (my Lord) and being hers,\r\nShe may (I thinke) bestow't on any man\r\n\r\n   Oth. She is Protectresse of her honor too:\r\nMay she giue that?\r\n  Iago. Her honor is an Essence that's not seene,\r\nThey haue it very oft, that haue it not.\r\nBut for the Handkerchiefe\r\n\r\n   Othe. By heauen, I would most gladly haue forgot it:\r\nThou saidst (oh, it comes ore my memorie,\r\nAs doth the Rauen o're the infectious house:\r\nBoading to all) he had my Handkerchiefe\r\n\r\n   Iago . I: what of that?\r\n  Othe. That's not so good now\r\n\r\n   Iag. What if I had said, I had seene him do you wrong?\r\nOr heard him say (as Knaues be such abroad,\r\nWho hauing by their owne importunate suit,\r\nOr voluntary dotage of some Mistris,\r\nConuinced or supply'd them, cannot chuse\r\nBut they must blab.)\r\n  Oth. Hath he said any thing?\r\n  Iago. He hath (my Lord) but be you well assur'd,\r\nNo more then he'le vn-sweare\r\n\r\n   Oth. What hath he said?\r\n  Iago. Why, that he did: I know not what he did\r\n\r\n   Othe. What? What?\r\n  Iago. Lye\r\n\r\n   Oth. With her?\r\n  Iago. With her? On her: what you will\r\n\r\n   Othe. Lye with her? lye on her? We say lye on her,\r\nwhen they be-lye-her. Lye with her: that's fullsome:\r\nHandkerchiefe: Confessions: Handkerchiefe. To confesse,\r\nand be hang'd for his labour. First, to be hang'd,\r\nand then to confesse: I tremble at it. Nature would not\r\ninuest her selfe in such shadowing passion, without some\r\nInstruction. It is not words that shakes me thus, (pish)\r\nNoses, Eares, and Lippes: is't possible. Confesse? Handkerchiefe?\r\nO diuell.\r\n\r\nFalls in a Traunce.\r\n\r\n  Iago. Worke on,\r\nMy Medicine workes. Thus credulous Fooles are caught,\r\nAnd many worthy, and chast Dames euen thus,\r\n(All guiltlesse) meete reproach: what hoa? My Lord?\r\nMy Lord, I say: Othello.\r\nEnter Cassio.\r\n\r\nHow now Cassio?\r\n  Cas. What's the matter?\r\n  Iago. My Lord is falne into an Epilepsie,\r\nThis is his second Fit: he had one yesterday\r\n\r\n   Cas. Rub him about the Temples\r\n\r\n   Iago. The Lethargie must haue his quyet course:\r\nIf not, he foames at mouth: and by and by\r\nBreakes out to sauage madnesse. Looke, he stirres:\r\nDo you withdraw your selfe a little while,\r\nHe will recouer straight: when he is gone,\r\nI would on great occasion, speake with you.\r\nHow is it Generall? Haue you not hurt your head?\r\n  Othe. Dost thou mocke me?\r\n  Iago. I mocke you not, by Heauen:\r\nWould you would beare your Fortune like a Man\r\n\r\n   Othe. A Horned man's a Monster, and a Beast\r\n\r\n   Iago. Ther's many a Beast then in a populous Citty,\r\nAnd many a ciuill Monster\r\n\r\n   Othe. Did he confesse it?\r\n  Iago. Good Sir, be a man:\r\nThinke euery bearded fellow that's but yoak'd\r\nMay draw with you. There's Millions now aliue,\r\nThat nightly lye in those vnproper beds,\r\nWhich they dare sweare peculiar. Your case is better.\r\nOh, 'tis the spight of hell, the Fiends Arch-mock,\r\nTo lip a wanton in a secure Cowch;\r\nAnd to suppose her chast. No, let me know,\r\nAnd knowing what I am, I know what she shallbe\r\n\r\n   Oth. Oh, thou art wise: 'tis certaine\r\n\r\n   Iago. Stand you a while apart,\r\nConfine your selfe but in a patient List,\r\nWhil'st you were heere, o're-whelmed with your griefe\r\n(A passion most resulting such a man)\r\nCassio came hither: I shifted him away,\r\nAnd layd good scuses vpon your Extasie,\r\nBad him anon returne: and heere speake with me,\r\nThe which he promis'd. Do but encaue your selfe,\r\nAnd marke the Fleeres, the Gybes, and notable Scornes\r\nThat dwell in euery Region of his face.\r\nFor I will make him tell the Tale anew;\r\nWhere, how, how oft, how long ago, and when\r\nHe hath, and is againe to cope your wife.\r\nI say, but marke his gesture: marry Patience,\r\nOr I shall say y'are all in all in Spleene,\r\nAnd nothing of a man\r\n\r\n   Othe. Do'st thou heare, Iago,\r\nI will be found most cunning in my Patience:\r\nBut (do'st thou heare) most bloody\r\n\r\n   Iago. That's not amisse,\r\nBut yet keepe time in all: will you withdraw?\r\nNow will I question Cassio of Bianca,\r\nA Huswife that by selling her desires\r\nBuyes her selfe Bread, and Cloath. It is a Creature\r\nThat dotes on Cassio, (as 'tis the Strumpets plague\r\nTo be-guile many, and be be-guil'd by one)\r\nHe, when he heares of her, cannot restraine\r\nFrom the excesse of Laughter. Heere he comes.\r\nEnter Cassio.\r\n\r\nAs he shall smile, Othello shall go mad:\r\nAnd his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue\r\nPoore Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behauiours\r\nQuite in the wrong. How do you Lieutenant?\r\n  Cas. The worser, that you giue me the addition,\r\nWhose want euen killes me\r\n\r\n   Iago. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't:\r\nNow, if this Suit lay in Bianca's dowre,\r\nHow quickely should you speed?\r\n  Cas. Alas poore Caitiffe\r\n\r\n   Oth. Looke how he laughes already\r\n\r\n   Iago. I neuer knew woman loue man so\r\n\r\n   Cas. Alas poore Rogue, I thinke indeed she loues me\r\n\r\n   Oth. Now he denies it faintly: and laughes it out\r\n\r\n   Iago. Do you heare Cassio?\r\n  Oth. Now he importunes him\r\nTo tell it o're: go too, well said, well said\r\n\r\n   Iago. She giues it out, that you shall marry her.\r\nDo you intend it?\r\n  Cas. Ha, ha, ha\r\n\r\n   Oth. Do ye triumph, Romaine? do you triumph?\r\n  Cas. I marry. What? A customer; prythee beare\r\nSome Charitie to my wit, do not thinke it\r\nSo vnwholesome. Ha, ha, ha\r\n\r\n   Oth. So, so, so, so: they laugh, that winnes\r\n\r\n   Iago. Why the cry goes, that you marry her\r\n\r\n   Cas. Prythee say true\r\n\r\n   Iago. I am a very Villaine else\r\n\r\n   Oth. Haue you scoar'd me? Well\r\n\r\n   Cas. This is the Monkeys owne giuing out:\r\nShe is perswaded I will marry her\r\nOut of her owne loue & flattery, not out of my promise\r\n\r\n   Oth. Iago becomes me: now he begins the story\r\n\r\n   Cassio. She was heere euen now: she haunts me in euery\r\nplace. I was the other day talking on the Seabanke\r\nwith certaine Venetians, and thither comes the\r\nBauble, and falls me thus about my neck\r\n\r\n   Oth. Crying oh deere Cassio, as it were: his iesture imports\r\nit\r\n\r\n   Cassio. So hangs, and lolls, and weepes vpon me:\r\nSo shakes, and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha\r\n\r\n   Oth. Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Chamber:\r\noh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dogge, I\r\nshall throw it to\r\n\r\n   Cassio. Well, I must leaue her companie\r\n\r\n   Iago. Before me: looke where she comes.\r\nEnter Bianca.\r\n\r\n  Cas. 'Tis such another Fitchew: marry a perfum'd one?\r\nWhat do you meane by this haunting of me?\r\n  Bian. Let the diuell, and his dam haunt you: what\r\ndid you meane by that same Handkerchiefe, you gaue\r\nme euen now? I was a fine Foole to take it: I must take\r\nout the worke? A likely piece of worke, that you should\r\nfinde it in your Chamber, and know not who left it there.\r\nThis is some Minxes token, & I must take out the worke?\r\nThere, giue it your Hobbey-horse, wheresoeuer you had\r\nit, Ile take out no worke on't\r\n\r\n   Cassio. How now, my sweete Bianca?\r\nHow now? How now?\r\n  Othe. By Heauen, that should be my Handkerchiefe\r\n\r\n   Bian. If you'le come to supper to night you may, if\r\nyou will not come when you are next prepar'd for.\r\n\r\nExit\r\n\r\n  Iago. After her: after her\r\n\r\n   Cas. I must, shee'l rayle in the streets else\r\n\r\n   Iago. Will you sup there?\r\n  Cassio. Yes, I intend so\r\n\r\n   Iago. Well, I may chance to see you: for I would very\r\nfaine speake with you\r\n\r\n   Cas. Prythee come: will you?\r\n  Iago. Go too; say no more\r\n\r\n   Oth. How shall I murther him, Iago\r\n\r\n   Iago. Did you perceiue how he laugh'd at his vice?\r\n  Oth. Oh, Iago\r\n\r\n   Iago. And did you see the Handkerchiefe?\r\n  Oth. Was that mine?\r\n  Iago. Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes\r\nthe foolish woman your wife: she gaue it him and, he\r\nhath giu'n it his whore\r\n\r\n   Oth. I would haue him nine yeeres a killing:\r\nA fine woman, a faire woman, a sweete woman?\r\n  Iago. Nay, you must forget that\r\n\r\n   Othello. I, let her rot and perish, and be damn'd to\r\nnight, for she shall not liue. No, my heart is turn'd to\r\nstone: I strike it, and it hurts my hand. Oh, the world\r\nhath not a sweeter Creature: she might lye by an Emperours\r\nside, and command him Taskes\r\n\r\n   Iago. Nay, that's not your way\r\n\r\n   Othe. Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate\r\nwith her Needle: an admirable Musitian. Oh she will\r\nsing the Sauagenesse out of a Beare: of so high and plenteous\r\nwit, and inuention?\r\n  Iago. She's the worse for all this\r\n\r\n   Othe. Oh, a thousand, a thousand times:\r\nAnd then of so gentle a condition?\r\n  Iago. I too gentle\r\n\r\n   Othe. Nay that's certaine:\r\nBut yet the pitty of it, Iago: oh Iago, the pitty of it\r\nIago\r\n\r\n   Iago. If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie: giue her\r\npattent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes neere\r\nno body\r\n\r\n   Oth. I will chop her into Messes: Cuckold me?\r\n  Iago. Oh, 'tis foule in her\r\n\r\n   Oth. With mine Officer?\r\n  Iago. That's fouler\r\n\r\n   Othe. Get me some poyson, Iago, this night. Ile not\r\nexpostulate with her: least her body and beautie vnprouide\r\nmy mind againe: this night Iago\r\n\r\n   Iago. Do it not with poyson, strangle her in her bed,\r\nEuen the bed she hath contaminated\r\n\r\n   Oth. Good, good:\r\nThe Iustice of it pleases: very good\r\n\r\n   Iago. And for Cassio, let me be his vndertaker:\r\nYou shall heare more by midnight.\r\nEnter Lodouico, Desdemona, and Attendants.\r\n\r\n  Othe. Excellent good: What Trumpet is that same?\r\n  Iago. I warrant something from Venice,\r\n'Tis Lodouico, this, comes from the Duke.\r\nSee, your wife's with him\r\n\r\n   Lodo. Saue you worthy Generall\r\n\r\n   Othe. With all my heart Sir\r\n\r\n   Lod. The Duke, and the Senators of Venice greet you\r\n\r\n   Othe. I kisse the Instrument of their pleasures\r\n\r\n   Des. And what's the newes, good cozen Lodouico\r\n  Iago. I am very glad to see you Signior:\r\nWelcome to Cyprus\r\n\r\n   Lod. I thanke you: how do's Lieutenant Cassio?\r\n  Iago. Liues Sir,\r\n  Des. Cozen, there's falne betweene him, & my Lord,\r\nAn vnkind breach: but you shall make all well\r\n\r\n   Othe. Are you sure of that?\r\n  Des. My Lord?\r\n  Othe. This faile you not to do, as you will-\r\n  Lod. He did not call: he's busie in the paper,\r\nIs there deuision 'twixt my Lord, and Cassio?\r\n  Des. A most vnhappy one: I would do much\r\nT' attone, them, for the loue I beare to Cassio\r\n\r\n   Oth. Fire, and brimestone\r\n\r\n   Des. My Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. Are you wise?\r\n  Des. What is he angrie?\r\n  Lod. May be the Letter mou'd him.\r\nFor as I thinke, they do command him home,\r\nDeputing Cassio in his Gouernment\r\n\r\n   Des. Trust me, I am glad on't\r\n\r\n   Othe. Indeed?\r\n  Des. My Lord?\r\n  Othe. I am glad to see you mad\r\n\r\n   Des. Why, sweete Othello?\r\n  Othe. Diuell\r\n\r\n   Des. I haue not deseru'd this\r\n\r\n   Lod. My Lord, this would not be beleeu'd in Venice,\r\nThough I should sweare I saw't. 'Tis very much,\r\nMake her amends: she weepes\r\n\r\n   Othe. Oh diuell, diuell:\r\nIf that the Earth could teeme with womans teares,\r\nEach drop she falls, would proue a Crocodile:\r\nOut of my sight\r\n\r\n   Des. I will not stay to offend you\r\n\r\n   Lod. Truely obedient Lady:\r\nI do beseech your Lordship call her backe\r\n\r\n   Othe. Mistris\r\n\r\n   Des. My Lord\r\n\r\n   Othe. What would you with her, Sir?\r\n  Lod. Who I, my Lord?\r\n  Othe. I, you did wish, that I would make her turne:\r\nSir, she can turne, and turne: and yet go on\r\nAnd turne againe. And she can weepe, Sir, weepe.\r\nAnd she's obedient: as you say obedient.\r\nVery obedient: proceed you in your teares.\r\nConcerning this Sir, (oh well-painted passion)\r\nI am commanded home: get you away:\r\nIle send for you anon. Sir I obey the Mandate,\r\nAnd will returne to Venice. Hence, auaunt:\r\nCassio shall haue my Place. And Sir, to night\r\nI do entreat, that we may sup together.\r\nYou are welcome Sir to Cyprus.\r\nGoates, and Monkeys.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Lod. Is this the Noble Moore, whom our full Senate\r\nCall all in all sufficient? Is this the Nature\r\nWhom Passion could not shake? Whose solid vertue\r\nThe shot of Accident, nor dart of Chance\r\nCould neither graze, nor pierce?\r\n  Iago. He is much chang'd\r\n\r\n   Lod. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of Braine?\r\n  Iago. He's that he is: I may not breath my censure.\r\nWhat he might be: if what he might, he is not,\r\nI would to heauen he were\r\n\r\n   Lod. What? Strike his wife?\r\n  Iago. 'Faith that was not so well: yet would I knew\r\nThat stroke would proue the worst\r\n\r\n   Lod. Is it his vse?\r\nOr did the Letters, worke vpon his blood,\r\nAnd new create his fault?\r\n  Iago. Alas, alas:\r\nIt is not honestie in me to speake\r\nWhat I haue seene, and knowne. You shall obserue him,\r\nAnd his owne courses will denote him so,\r\nThat I may saue my speech: do but go after\r\nAnd marke how he continues\r\n\r\n   Lod. I am sorry that I am deceiu'd in him.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Secunda.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello and aemilia.\r\n\r\n  Othe. You haue seene nothing then?\r\nAemil. Nor euer heard: nor euer did suspect\r\n\r\n   Othe. Yes, you haue seene Cassio, and she together\r\n\r\n   Aemi. But then I saw no harme: and then I heard,\r\nEach syllable that breath made vp betweene them\r\n\r\n   Othe. What? Did they neuer whisper?\r\nAemil. Neuer my Lord\r\n\r\n   Othe. Nor send you out o'th' way?\r\nAemil. Neuer\r\n\r\n   Othe. To fetch her Fan, her Gloues, her Mask, nor nothing?\r\nAemil. Neuer my Lord\r\n\r\n   Othe. That's strange.\r\nAemil. I durst (my Lord) to wager, she is honest:\r\nLay downe my Soule at stake: If you thinke other,\r\nRemoue your thought. It doth abuse your bosome:\r\nIf any wretch haue put this in your head,\r\nLet Heauen requit it with the Serpents curse,\r\nFor if she be not honest, chaste, and true,\r\nThere's no man happy. The purest of their Wiues\r\nIs foule as Slander\r\n\r\n   Othe. Bid her come hither: go.\r\n\r\nExit aemilia.\r\n\r\nShe saies enough: yet she's a simple Baud\r\nThat cannot say as much. This is a subtile Whore:\r\nA Closset Locke and Key of Villanous Secrets,\r\nAnd yet she'le kneele, and pray: I haue seene her do't.\r\nEnter Desdemona, and aemilia.\r\n\r\n  Des. My Lord, what is your will?\r\n  Othe. Pray you Chucke come hither\r\n\r\n   Des. What is your pleasure?\r\n  Oth. Let me see your eyes: looke in my face\r\n\r\n   Des. What horrible Fancie's this?\r\n  Othe. Some of your Function Mistris:\r\nLeaue Procreants alone, and shut the doore:\r\nCough, or cry hem; if any body come:\r\nYour Mystery, your Mystery: May dispatch.\r\n\r\nExit aemi.\r\n\r\n  Des. Vpon my knee, what doth your speech import?\r\nI vnderstand a Fury in your words\r\n\r\n   Othe. Why? What art thou?\r\n  Des. Your wife my Lord: your true and loyall wife\r\n\r\n   Othello. Come sweare it: damne thy selfe, least\r\nbeing like one of Heauen, the diuells themselues should\r\nfeare to ceaze thee. Therefore be double damn'd: sweare\r\nthou art honest\r\n\r\n   Des. Heauen doth truely know it\r\n\r\n   Othe. Heauen truely knowes, that thou art false as hell\r\n\r\n   Des. To whom my Lord?\r\nWith whom? How am I false?\r\n  Othe. Ah Desdemon, away, away, away\r\n\r\n   Des. Alas the heauy day: why do you weepe?\r\nAm I the motiue of these teares my Lord?\r\nIf happely you my Father do suspect,\r\nAn Instrument of this your calling backe,\r\nLay not your blame on me: if you haue lost him,\r\nI haue lost him too\r\n\r\n   Othe. Had it pleas'd Heauen,\r\nTo try me with Affliction, had they rain'd\r\nAll kind of Sores, and Shames on my bare-head:\r\nSteep'd me in pouertie to the very lippes.\r\nGiuen to Captiuitie, me, and my vtmost hopes,\r\nI should haue found in some place of my Soule\r\nA drop of patience. But alas, to make me\r\nThe fixed Figure for the time of Scorne,\r\nTo point his slow, and mouing finger at.\r\nYet could I beare that too, well, very well:\r\nBut there where I haue garnerd vp my heart,\r\nWhere either I must liue, or beare no life,\r\nThe Fountaine from the which my currant runnes,\r\nOr else dries vp: to be discarded thence,\r\nOr keepe it as a Cesterne, for foule Toades\r\nTo knot and gender in. Turne thy complexion there:\r\nPatience, thou young and Rose-lip'd Cherubin,\r\nI heere looke grim as hell\r\n\r\n   Des. I hope my Noble Lord esteemes me honest\r\n\r\n   Othe. Oh I, as Sommer Flyes are in the Shambles,\r\nThat quicken euen with blowing. Oh thou weed:\r\nWho art so louely faire, and smell'st so sweete,\r\nThat the Sense akes at thee,\r\nWould thou had'st neuer bin borne\r\n\r\n   Des. Alas, what ignorant sin haue I committed?\r\n  Othe. Was this faire Paper? This most goodly Booke\r\nMade to write Whore vpon? What commited,\r\nCommitted? Oh, thou publicke Commoner,\r\nI should make very Forges of my cheekes,\r\nThat would to Cynders burne vp Modestie,\r\nDid I but speake thy deedes. What commited?\r\nHeauen stoppes the Nose at it, and the Moone winks:\r\nThe baudy winde that kisses all it meetes,\r\nIs hush'd within the hollow Myne of Earth\r\nAnd will not hear't. What commited?\r\n  Des. By Heauen you do me wrong\r\n\r\n   Othe. Are not you a Strumpet?\r\n  Des. No, as I am a Christian.\r\nIf to preserue this vessell for my Lord,\r\nFrom any other foule vnlawfull touch\r\nBe not to be a Strumpet, I am none\r\n\r\n   Othe. What, not a Whore?\r\n  Des. No, as I shall be sau'd\r\n\r\n   Othe. Is't possible?\r\n  Des. Oh Heauen forgiue vs\r\n\r\n   Othe. I cry you mercy then.\r\nI tooke you for that cunning Whore of Venice,\r\nThat married with Othello. You Mistris,\r\nEnter aemilia.\r\n\r\nThat haue the office opposite to Saint Peter,\r\nAnd keepes the gate of hell. You, you: I you.\r\nWe haue done our course: there's money for your paines:\r\nI pray you turne the key, and keepe our counsaile.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\nAemil. Alas, what do's this Gentleman conceiue?\r\nHow do you Madam? how do you my good Lady?\r\n  Des. Faith, halfe a sleepe\r\n\r\n   Aemi. Good Madam,\r\nWhat's the matter with my Lord?\r\n  Des. With who?\r\nAemil. Why, with my Lord, Madam?\r\n  Des. Who is thy Lord?\r\nAemil. He that is yours, sweet Lady\r\n\r\n   Des. I haue none: do not talke to me, aemilia,\r\nI cannot weepe: nor answeres haue I none,\r\nBut what should go by water. Prythee to night,\r\nLay on my bed my wedding sheetes, remember,\r\nAnd call thy husband hither.\r\nAemil. Heere's a change indeed.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Des. 'Tis meete I should be vs'd so: very meete.\r\nHow haue I bin behau'd, that he might sticke\r\nThe small'st opinion on my least misvse?\r\nEnter Iago, and aemilia.\r\n\r\n  Iago. What is your pleasure Madam?\r\nHow is't with you?\r\n  Des. I cannot tell: those that do teach yong Babes\r\nDo it with gentle meanes, and easie taskes.\r\nHe might haue chid me so; for in good faith\r\nI am a Child to chiding\r\n\r\n   Iago. What is the matter Lady?\r\nAemil. Alas (Iago) my Lord hath so bewhor'd her,\r\nThrowne such dispight, and heauy termes vpon her\r\nThat true hearts cannot beare it\r\n\r\n   Des. Am I that name, Iago?\r\n  Iago. What name, (faire Lady?)\r\n  Des. Such as she said my Lord did say I was.\r\nAemil. He call'd her whore: a Begger in his drinke:\r\nCould not haue laid such termes vpon his Callet\r\n\r\n   Iago. Why did he so?\r\n  Des. I do not know: I am sure I am none such\r\n\r\n   Iago. Do not weepe, do not weepe: alas the day.\r\nAemil. Hath she forsooke so many Noble Matches?\r\nHer Father? And her Country? And her Friends?\r\nTo be call'd Whore? Would it not make one weepe?\r\n  Des. It is my wretched Fortune\r\n\r\n   Iago. Beshrew him for't:\r\nHow comes this Tricke vpon him?\r\n  Des. Nay, Heauen doth know\r\n\r\n   Aemi. I will be hang'd, if some eternall Villaine,\r\nSome busie and insinuating Rogue,\r\nSome cogging, cozening Slaue, to get some Office,\r\nHaue not deuis'd this Slander: I will be hang'd else\r\n\r\n   Iago. Fie, there is no such man: it is impossible\r\n\r\n   Des. If any such there be, Heauen pardon him.\r\nAemil. A halter pardon him:\r\nAnd hell gnaw his bones.\r\nWhy should he call her Whore?\r\nWho keepes her companie?\r\nWhat Place? What Time?\r\nWhat Forme? What liklyhood?\r\nThe Moore's abus'd by some most villanous Knaue,\r\nSome base notorious Knaue, some scuruy Fellow.\r\nOh Heauens, that such companions thou'd'st vnfold,\r\nAnd put in euery honest hand a whip\r\nTo lash the Rascalls naked through the world,\r\nEuen from the East to th' West\r\n\r\n   Iago. Speake within doore.\r\nAemil. Oh fie vpon them: some such Squire he was\r\nThat turn'd your wit, the seamy-side without,\r\nAnd made you to suspect me with the Moore\r\n\r\n   Iago. You are a Foole: go too\r\n\r\n   Des. Alas Iago,\r\nWhat shall I do to win my Lord againe?\r\nGood Friend, go to him: for by this light of Heauen,\r\nI know not how I lost him. Heere I kneele:\r\nIf ere my will did trespasse 'gainst his Loue,\r\nEither in discourse of thought, or actuall deed,\r\nOr that mine Eyes, mine Eares, or any Sence\r\nDelighted them: or any other Forme.\r\nOr that I do not yet, and euer did,\r\nAnd euer will, (though he do shake me off\r\nTo beggerly diuorcement) Loue him deerely,\r\nComfort forsweare me. Vnkindnesse may do much,\r\nAnd his vnkindnesse may defeat my life,\r\nBut neuer taynt my Loue. I cannot say Whore,\r\nIt do's abhorre me now I speake the word,\r\nTo do the Act, that might the addition earne,\r\nNot the worlds Masse of vanitie could make me\r\n\r\n   Iago. I pray you be content: 'tis but his humour:\r\nThe businesse of the State do's him offence\r\n\r\n   Des. If 'twere no other\r\n\r\n   Iago. It is but so, I warrant,\r\nHearke how these Instruments summon to supper:\r\nThe Messengers of Venice staies the meate,\r\nGo in, and weepe not: all things shall be well.\r\n\r\nExeunt. Desdemona and aemilia.\r\n\r\nEnter Rodorigo.\r\n\r\nHow now Rodorigo?\r\n  Rod. I do not finde\r\nThat thou deal'st iustly with me\r\n\r\n   Iago. What in the contrarie?\r\n  Rodori. Euery day thou dafts me with some deuise\r\nIago, and rather, as it seemes to me now, keep'st from\r\nme all conueniencie, then suppliest me with the least aduantage\r\nof hope: I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor\r\nam I yet perswaded to put vp in peace, what already I\r\nhaue foolishly suffred\r\n\r\n   Iago. Will you heare me Rodorigo?\r\n  Rodori. I haue heard too much: and your words and\r\nPerformances are no kin together\r\n\r\n   Iago. You charge me most vniustly\r\n\r\n   Rodo. With naught but truth: I haue wasted my\r\nselfe out of my meanes. The Iewels you haue had from\r\nme to deliuer Desdemona, would halfe haue corrupted a\r\nVotarist. You haue told me she hath receiu'd them,\r\nand return'd me expectations and comforts of sodaine\r\nrespect, and acquaintance, but I finde none\r\n\r\n   Iago. Well, go too: very well\r\n\r\n   Rod. Very well, go too: I cannot go too, (man) nor\r\n'tis not very well. Nay I think it is scuruy: and begin to\r\nfinde my selfe fopt in it\r\n\r\n   Iago. Very well\r\n\r\n   Rodor. I tell you, 'tis not very well: I will make my\r\nselfe knowne to Desdemona. If she will returne me my\r\nIewels, I will giue ouer my Suit, and repent my vnlawfull\r\nsolicitation. If not, assure your selfe, I will seeke\r\nsatisfaction of you\r\n\r\n   Iago. You haue said now\r\n\r\n   Rodo. I: and said nothing but what I protest intendment\r\nof doing\r\n\r\n   Iago. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee: and\r\neuen from this instant do build on thee a better opinion\r\nthen euer before: giue me thy hand Rodorigo.\r\nThou hast taken against me a most iust exception:\r\nbut yet I protest I haue dealt most directly in thy\r\nAffaire\r\n\r\n   Rod. It hath not appeer'd\r\n\r\n   Iago. I grant indeed it hath not appeer'd: and\r\nyour suspition is not without wit and iudgement.\r\nBut Rodorigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which\r\nI haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer (I\r\nmeane purpose, Courage, and Valour) this night\r\nshew it. If thou the next night following enioy not\r\nDesdemona, take me from this world with Treacherie,\r\nand deuise Engines for my life\r\n\r\n   Rod. Well: what is it? Is it within, reason and compasse?\r\n  Iago. Sir, there is especiall Commission come from\r\nVenice to depute Cassio in Othello's place\r\n\r\n   Rod. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona\r\nreturne againe to Venice\r\n\r\n   Iago. Oh no: he goes into Mauritania and taketh\r\naway with him the faire Desdemona, vnlesse his abode\r\nbe lingred heere by some accident. Wherein\r\nnone can be so determinate, as the remouing of\r\nCassio\r\n\r\n   Rod. How do you meane remouing him?\r\n  Iago. Why, by making him vncapable of Othello's\r\nplace: knocking out his braines\r\n\r\n   Rod. And that you would haue me to do\r\n\r\n   Iago. I: if you dare do your selfe a profit, and a\r\nright. He sups to night with a Harlotry: and thither\r\nwill I go to him. He knowes not yet of his Honourable\r\nFortune, if you will watch his going thence (which\r\nI will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one)\r\nyou may take him at your pleasure. I will be neere\r\nto second your Attempt, and he shall fall betweene\r\nvs. Come, stand not amaz'd at it, but go along with\r\nme: I will shew you such a necessitie in his death, that\r\nyou shall thinke your selfe bound to put it on him. It\r\nis now high supper time: and the night growes to wast.\r\nAbout it\r\n\r\n   Rod. I will heare further reason for this\r\n\r\n   Iago. And you shalbe satisfi'd.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nScena Tertia.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello, Lodouico, Desdemona, aemilia, and Atendants.\r\n\r\n  Lod. I do beseech you Sir, trouble your selfe no further\r\n\r\n   Oth. Oh pardon me: 'twill do me good to walke\r\n\r\n   Lodoui. Madam, good night: I humbly thanke your\r\nLadyship\r\n\r\n   Des. Your Honour is most welcome\r\n\r\n   Oth. Will you walke Sir? Oh Desdemona\r\n\r\n   Des. My Lord\r\n\r\n   Othello. Get you to bed on th' instant, I will be return'd\r\nforthwith: dismisse your Attendant there: look't\r\nbe done.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Des. I will my Lord\r\n\r\n   Aem. How goes it now? He lookes gentler then he did\r\n\r\n   Des. He saies he will returne incontinent,\r\nAnd hath commanded me to go to bed,\r\nAnd bid me to dismisse you\r\n\r\n   Aemi. Dismisse me?\r\n  Des. It was his bidding: therefore good aemilia,\r\nGiue me my nightly wearing, and adieu.\r\nWe must not now displease him.\r\nAemil. I, would you had neuer seene him\r\n\r\n   Des. So would not I: my loue doth so approue him,\r\nThat euen his stubbornesse, his checks, his frownes,\r\n(Prythee vn-pin me) haue grace and fauour\r\n\r\n   Aemi. I haue laid those Sheetes you bad me on the bed\r\n\r\n   Des. All's one: good Father, how foolish are our minds?\r\nIf I do die before, prythee shrow'd me\r\nIn one of these same Sheetes.\r\nAemil. Come, come: you talke\r\n\r\n   Des. My Mother had a Maid call'd Barbarie,\r\nShe was in loue: and he she lou'd prou'd mad,\r\nAnd did forsake her. She had a Song of Willough,\r\nAn old thing 'twas: but it express'd her Fortune,\r\nAnd she dy'd singing it. That Song to night,\r\nWill not go from my mind: I haue much to do,\r\nBut to go hang my head all at one side\r\nAnd sing it like poore Barbarie: prythee dispatch\r\n\r\n   Aemi. Shall I go fetch your Night-gowne?\r\n  Des. No, vn-pin me here,\r\nThis Lodouico is a proper man.\r\nAemil. A very handsome man\r\n\r\n   Des. He speakes well.\r\nAemil. I know a Lady in Venice would haue walk'd\r\nbarefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip\r\n\r\n   Des. The poore Soule sat singing, by a Sicamour tree.\r\nSing all a greene Willough:\r\nHer hand on her bosome her head on her knee,\r\nSing Willough, Willough, Willough.\r\nThe fresh Streames ran by her, and murmur'd her moanes\r\nSing Willough, &c.\r\nHer salt teares fell from her, and softned the stones,\r\nSing Willough, &c. (Lay by these)\r\nWillough, Willough. (Prythee high thee: he'le come anon)\r\nSing all a greene Willough must be my Garland.\r\nLet no body blame him, his scorne I approue.\r\n(Nay that's not next. Harke, who is't that knocks?\r\nAemil. It's the wind\r\n\r\n   Des. I call'd my Loue false Loue: but what said he then?\r\nSing Willough, &c.\r\nIf I court mo women, you'le couch with mo men.\r\nSo get thee gone, good night: mine eyes do itch:\r\nDoth that boade weeping?\r\nAemil. 'Tis neyther heere, nor there\r\n\r\n   Des. I haue heard it said so. O these Men, these men!\r\nDo'st thou in conscience thinke (tell me aemilia)\r\nThat there be women do abuse their husbands\r\nIn such grosse kinde?\r\nAemil. There be some such, no question\r\n\r\n   Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for all the world?\r\nAemil. Why, would not you?\r\n  Des. No, by this Heauenly light.\r\nAemil. Nor I neither, by this Heauenly light:\r\nI might doo't as well i'th' darke\r\n\r\n   Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for al the world?\r\nAemil. The world's a huge thing:\r\nIt is a great price, for a small vice\r\n\r\n   Des. Introth, I thinke thou would'st not.\r\nAemil. Introth I thinke I should, and vndoo't when\r\nI had done. Marry, I would not doe such a thing for a\r\nioynt Ring, nor for measures of Lawne, nor for Gownes,\r\nPetticoats, nor Caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for\r\nall the whole world: why, who would not make her husband\r\na Cuckold, to make him a Monarch? I should venture\r\nPurgatory for't\r\n\r\n   Des. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong\r\nFor the whole world.\r\nAemil. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i'th' world;\r\nand hauing the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in\r\nyour owne world, and you might quickly make it right\r\n\r\n   Des. I do not thinke there is any such woman.\r\nAemil. Yes, a dozen: and as many to'th' vantage, as\r\nwould store the world they plaid for.\r\nBut I do thinke it is their Husbands faults\r\nIf Wiues do fall: (Say, that they slacke their duties,\r\nAnd powre our Treasures into forraigne laps;\r\nOr else breake out in peeuish Iealousies,\r\nThrowing restraint vpon vs: Or say they strike vs,\r\nOr scant our former hauing in despight)\r\nWhy we haue galles: and though we haue some Grace,\r\nYet haue we some Reuenge. Let Husbands know,\r\nTheir wiues haue sense like them: They see, and smell,\r\nAnd haue their Palats both for sweet, and sowre,\r\nAs Husbands haue. What is it that they do,\r\nWhen they change vs for others? Is it Sport?\r\nI thinke it is: and doth Affection breed it?\r\nI thinke it doth. Is't Frailty that thus erres?\r\nIt is so too. And haue not we Affections?\r\nDesires for Sport? and Frailty, as men haue?\r\nThen let them vse vs well: else let them know,\r\nThe illes we do, their illes instruct vs so\r\n\r\n   Des. Good night, good night:\r\nHeauen me such vses send,\r\nNot to picke bad, from bad; but by bad, mend.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nActus Quintus. Scena Prima.\r\n\r\nEnter Iago, and Rodorigo.\r\n\r\n  Iago. Heere, stand behinde this Barke,\r\nStraight will he come:\r\nWeare thy good Rapier bare, and put it home:\r\nQuicke, quicke, feare nothing; Ile be at thy Elbow,\r\nIt makes vs, or it marres vs, thinke on that,\r\nAnd fixe most firme thy Resolution\r\n\r\n   Rod. Be neere at hand, I may miscarry in't\r\n\r\n   Iago. Heere, at thy hand: Be bold, & take thy stand\r\n\r\n   Rod. I haue no great deuotion to the deed,\r\nAnd yet he hath giuen me satisfying Reasons:\r\n'Tis but a man gone. Forth my Sword: he dies\r\n\r\n   Iago. I haue rub'd this yong Quat almost to the sense,\r\nAnd he growes angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,\r\nOr Cassio him, or each do kill the other,\r\nEuery way makes my gaine. Liue Rodorigo,\r\nHe calles me to a restitution large\r\nOf Gold, and Iewels, that I bob'd from him,\r\nAs Guifts to Desdemona.\r\nIt must not be: If Cassio do remaine,\r\nHe hath a dayly beauty in his life,\r\nThat makes me vgly: and besides, the Moore\r\nMay vnfold me to him: there stand I in much perill:\r\nNo, he must dye. But so, I heard him comming.\r\nEnter Cassio.\r\n\r\n  Rod. I know his gate, 'tis he: Villaine thou dyest\r\n\r\n   Cas. That thrust had beene mine enemy indeed,\r\nBut that my Coate is better then thou know'st:\r\nI will make proofe of thine\r\n\r\n   Rod. Oh, I am slaine\r\n\r\n   Cassio. I am maym'd for euer:\r\nHelpe hoa: Murther, murther.\r\nEnter Othello.\r\n\r\n  Oth. The voyce of Cassio. Iago keepes his word\r\n\r\n   Rod. O Villaine that I am\r\n\r\n   Oth.

Minion, your deere lyes dead,\r\nAnd your vnblest Fate highes: Strumpet I come:\r\nFor of my heart, those Charmes thine Eyes, are blotted.\r\nThy Bed lust-stain'd, shall with Lusts blood bee spotted.\r\n\r\nExit Othello.\r\n\r\nEnter Lodouico and Gratiano.\r\n\r\n  Cas.

What's the matter?\r\n  Gra. This is Othello's Ancient, as I take it\r\n\r\n   Lodo. The same indeede, a very valiant Fellow\r\n\r\n   Iago. What are you heere, that cry so greeuously?\r\n  Cas. Iago? Oh I am spoyl'd, vndone by Villaines:\r\nGiue me some helpe\r\n\r\n   Iago. O mee, Lieutenant!\r\nWhat Villaines haue done this?\r\n  Cas. I thinke that one of them is heereabout.\r\nAnd cannot make away\r\n\r\n   Iago. Oh treacherous Villaines:\r\nWhat are you there? Come in, and giue some helpe\r\n\r\n   Rod. O helpe me there\r\n\r\n   Cassio. That's one of them\r\n\r\n   Iago. Oh murd'rous Slaue! O Villaine!\r\n  Rod. O damn'd Iago! O inhumane Dogge!\r\n  Iago.

Gentlemen all, I do suspect this Trash\r\nTo be a party in this Iniurie.\r\nPatience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;\r\nLend me a Light: know we this face, or no?\r\nAlas my Friend, and my deere Countryman\r\nRodorigo? No: Yes sure: Yes, 'tis Rodorigo\r\n\r\n   Gra. What, of Venice?\r\n  Iago. Euen he Sir: Did you know him?\r\n  Gra. Know him? I\r\n\r\n   Iago. Signior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon:\r\nThese bloody accidents must excuse my Manners,\r\nThat so neglected you\r\n\r\n   Gra. I am glad to see you\r\n\r\n   Iago. How do you Cassio? Oh, a Chaire, a Chaire\r\n\r\n   Gra. Rodorigo?\r\n  Iago. He, he, 'tis he:\r\nOh that's well said, the Chaire.\r\nSome good man beare him carefully from hence,\r\nIle fetch the Generall's Surgeon. For you Mistris,\r\nSaue you your labour. He that lies slaine heere (Cassio)\r\nWas my deere friend. What malice was between you\r\n\r\n   Cas. None in the world: nor do I know the man?\r\n  Iago. What? looke you pale? Oh beare him o'th' Ayre.\r\nStay you good Gentlemen. Looke you pale, Mistris?\r\nDo you perceiue the gastnesse of her eye?\r\nNay, if you stare, we shall heare more anon.\r\nBehold her well: I pray you looke vpon her:\r\nDo you see Gentlemen? Nay, guiltinesse will speake\r\nThough tongues were out of vse.\r\nAemil. Alas, what is the matter?\r\nWhat is the matter, Husband?\r\n  Iago. Cassio hath heere bin set on in the darke\r\nBy Rodorigo, and Fellowes that are scap'd:\r\nHe's almost slaine, and Rodorigo quite dead.\r\nAemil. Alas good Gentleman: alas good Cassio\r\n\r\n   Iago. This is the fruits of whoring. Prythe aemilia,\r\nGo know of Cassio where he supt to night.\r\nWhat, do you shake at that?\r\n  Bian. He supt at my house, but I therefore shake not\r\n\r\n   Iago. O did he so? I charge you go with me.\r\nAemil. Oh fie vpon thee Strumpet\r\n\r\n   Bian. I am no Strumpet, but of life as honest,\r\nAs you that thus abuse me.\r\nAemil. As I? Fie vpon thee\r\n\r\n   Iago. Kinde Gentlemen:\r\nLet's go see poore Cassio drest.\r\nCome Mistris, you must tel's another Tale.\r\naemilia, run you to the Cittadell,\r\nAnd tell my Lord and Lady, what hath happ'd:\r\nWill you go on afore? This is the night\r\nThat either makes me, or foredoes me quight.\r\n\r\nExeunt.\r\n\r\nScoena Secunda.\r\n\r\nEnter Othello, and Desdemona in her bed.\r\n\r\n  Oth. It is the Cause, it is the Cause (my Soule)\r\nLet me not name it to you, you chaste Starres,\r\nIt is the Cause. Yet Ile not shed her blood,\r\nNor scarre that whiter skin of hers, then Snow,\r\nAnd smooth as Monumentall Alablaster:\r\nYet she must dye, else shee'l betray more men:\r\nPut out the Light, and then put out the Light:\r\nIf I quench thee, thou flaming Minister,\r\nI can againe thy former light restore,\r\nShould I repent me. But once put out thy Light,\r\nThou cunning'st Patterne of excelling Nature,\r\nI know not where is that Promethaean heate\r\nThat can thy Light re-Lume.\r\nWhen I haue pluck'd thy Rose,\r\nI cannot giue it vitall growth againe,\r\nIt needs must wither. Ile smell thee on the Tree.\r\nOh Balmy breath, that dost almost perswade\r\nIustice to breake her Sword. One more, one more:\r\nBe thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,\r\nAnd loue thee after. One more, and that's the last.\r\nSo sweet, was ne're so fatall. I must weepe,\r\nBut they are cruell Teares: This sorrow's heauenly,\r\nIt strikes, where it doth loue. She wakes\r\n\r\n   Des. Who's there? Othello?\r\n  Othel. I Desdemona\r\n\r\n   Des. Will you come to bed, my Lord?\r\n  Oth. Haue you pray'd to night, Desdemon?\r\n  Des. I my Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. If you bethinke your selfe of any Crime\r\nVnreconcil'd as yet to Heauen, and Grace,\r\nSolicite for it straight\r\n\r\n   Des. Alacke, my Lord,\r\nWhat may you meane by that?\r\n  Oth. Well, do it, and be breefe, I will walke by:\r\nI would not kill thy vnprepared Spirit,\r\nNo, Heauens fore-fend) I would not kill thy Soule\r\n\r\n   Des. Talke you of killing?\r\n  Oth. I, I do\r\n\r\n   Des. Then Heauen haue mercy on mee\r\n\r\n   Oth. Amen, with all my heart\r\n\r\n   Des. If you say, I hope you will not kill me\r\n\r\n   Oth. Humh\r\n\r\n   Des. And yet I feare you: for you're fatall then\r\nWhen your eyes rowle so.\r\nWhy I should feare, I know not,\r\nSince guiltinesse I know not: But yet I feele I feare\r\n\r\n   Oth. Thinke on thy sinnes\r\n\r\n   Des. They are Loues I beare to you\r\n\r\n   Oth. I, and for that thou dy'st\r\n\r\n   Des. That death's vnnaturall, that kils for louing.\r\nAlas, why gnaw you so your nether-lip?\r\nSome bloody passion shakes your very Frame:\r\nThese are portents: but yet I hope, I hope,\r\nThey do not point on me\r\n\r\n   Oth. Peace, and be still\r\n\r\n   Des. I will so: What's the matter?\r\n  Oth. That Handkerchiefe\r\nWhich I so lou'd, and gaue thee, thou gau'st to Cassio\r\n\r\n   Des. No by my Life, and Soule: send for the man,\r\nAnd aske him\r\n\r\n   Oth. Sweet Soule, take heed, take heed of Periury,\r\nThou art on thy death-bed\r\n\r\n   Des. I, but not yet to dye\r\n\r\n   Oth. Presently.\r\nTherefore confesse thee freely of thy sinne:\r\nFor to deny each Article with Oath,\r\nCannot remoue, nor choake the strong Conception\r\nThat I do grone withall. Thou art to dye\r\n\r\n   Des. O Heauen haue mercy on me\r\n\r\n   Oth. I say, Amen\r\n\r\n   Des. And haue you mercy too. I neuer did\r\nOffend you in my life: neuer lou'd Cassio,\r\nBut with such generall warrantie of Heauen,\r\nAs I might loue. I neuer gaue him Token\r\n\r\n   Oth. By Heauen I saw my Handkerchiefe in's hand.\r\nO periur'd woman, thou do'st stone my heart,\r\nAnd makes me call, what I intend to do,\r\nA Murther, which I thought a Sacrifice.\r\nI saw the Handkerchiefe\r\n\r\n   Des. He found it then:\r\nI neuer gaue it him: Send, for him hither:\r\nLet him confesse a truth\r\n\r\n   Oth. He hath confest\r\n\r\n   Des. What, my Lord?\r\n  Oth. That he hath vs'd thee\r\n\r\n   Des. How? vnlawfully?\r\n  Oth. I\r\n\r\n   Des. He will not say so\r\n\r\n   Oth. No: his mouth is stopp'd:\r\nHonest Iago hath 'tane order for't\r\n\r\n   Des. Oh, my feare interprets. What is he dead?\r\n  Oth. Had all his haires bin liues, my great Reuenge\r\nHad stomacke for them all\r\n\r\n   Des. Alas, he is betray'd, and I vndone\r\n\r\n   Oth. Out Strumpet: weep'st thou for him to my face?\r\n  Des. O banish me, my Lord, but kill me not\r\n\r\n   Oth. Downe Strumpet\r\n\r\n   Des. Kill me to morrow, let me liue to night\r\n\r\n   Oth. Nay, if you striue\r\n\r\n   Des. But halfe an houre\r\n\r\n   Oth. Being done, there is no pawse\r\n\r\n   Des. But while I say one prayer\r\n\r\n   Oth. It is too late.\r\n\r\nSmothers her.\r\n\r\naemilia at the doore.\r\n\r\nAemil. My Lord, my Lord? What hoa?\r\nMy Lord, my Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?\r\nI that am cruell, am yet mercifull,\r\nI would not haue thee linger in thy paine?\r\nSo, so.\r\nAemil. within. What hoa? my Lord, my Lord?\r\n  Oth. Who's there?\r\nAemil. Oh good my Lord, I would speake a word\r\nwith you\r\n\r\n   Oth. Yes: 'Tis aemilia: by and by. Shee's dead.\r\n'Tis like she comes to speake of Cassio's death:\r\nThe noise was high. Hah, no more moouing?\r\nStill as the Graue. Shall she come in? Wer't good?\r\nI thinke she stirres againe. No, what's best to do?\r\nIf she come in, shee'l sure speake to my wife:\r\nMy wife, my wife: what wife? I haue no wife.\r\nOh insupportable! Oh heauy houre!\r\nMe thinkes, it should be now a huge Eclipse\r\nOf Sunne, and Moone; and that th' affrighted Globe\r\nDid yawne at Alteration.\r\nAemil. I do beseech you\r\nThat I may speake with you. Oh good my Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. I had forgot thee: oh come in aemilia.\r\nSoft, by and by, let me the Curtaines draw.\r\nWhere art thou? What's the matter with thee now?\r\nEnter aemilia.\r\n\r\nAemil. Oh my good Lord, yonders foule Murthers\r\ndone\r\n\r\n   Oth. What? now?\r\nAemil. But now, my Lord\r\n\r\n   Oth. It is the very error of the Moone,\r\nShe comes more neerer Earth then she was wont,\r\nAnd makes men mad.\r\nAemil. Cassio, my Lord, hath kill'd\r\nA young Venetian, call'd Rodorigo\r\n\r\n   Oth. Rodorigo kill'd? and Cassio kill'd?\r\nAemil. No, Cassio is not kill'd\r\n\r\n   Oth. Not Cassio kill'd? Then Murther's out of tune,\r\nAnd sweet Reuenge growes harsh\r\n\r\n   Des. O falsely, falsely murder'd.\r\nAemil. Alas! what cry is that?\r\n  Oth. That? What?\r\nAemil. Out, and alas, that was my Ladies voice.\r\nHelpe, helpe hoa, helpe. Oh Ladie speake againe,\r\nSweet Desdemona, oh sweet Mistris, speake\r\n\r\n   Des. A guiltlesse death, I dye.\r\nAemil. Oh who hath done this deed?\r\n  Des. No body: I my selfe, farewell:\r\nCommend me to my kinde Lord: oh farewell\r\n\r\n   Oth. Why, how should she be murdred?\r\nAemil. Alas: who knowes?\r\n  Oth. You heare her say her selfe, it was not I.\r\nAemil. She said so: I must needs report the truth\r\n\r\n   Oth. She's like a Liar gone to burning hell,\r\n'Twas I that kill'd her.\r\nAemil. Oh the more Angell she, and you the blacker\r\nDiuell\r\n\r\n   Oth. She turn'd to folly: and she was a whore.\r\nAemil. Thou do'st bely her, and thou art a diuell\r\n\r\n   Oth. She was false as water.\r\nAemil. Thou art rash as fire, to say\r\nThat she was false. Oh she was heauenly true\r\n\r\n   Oth. Cassio did top her: Ask thy husband else.\r\nO, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell:\r\nBut that I did proceed vpon iust grounds\r\nTo this extremity. Thy Husband knew it all.\r\nAemil. My Husband?\r\n  Oth. Thy Husband.\r\nAemil. That she was false to Wedlocke?\r\n  Oth. I, with Cassio: had she bin true,\r\nIf Heauen would make me such another world,\r\nOf one entyre and perfect Chrysolite,\r\nI'ld not haue sold her for it.\r\nAemil. My Husband?\r\n  Oth. I, 'twas he that told me on her first,\r\nAn honest man he is, and hates the slime\r\nThat stickes on filthy deeds.\r\nAemil. My Husband?\r\n  Oth. What needs this itterance, Woman?\r\nI say, thy Husband.\r\nAemil. Oh Mistris,\r\nVillany hath made mockes with loue:\r\nMy Husband say she was false?\r\n  Oth. He, Woman;\r\nI say thy Husband: Do'st vnderstand the word?\r\nMy Friend, thy Husband; honest, honest Iago.\r\nAemil. If he say so, may his pernicious Soule\r\nRot halfe a graine a day: he lyes to'th' heart,\r\nShe was too fond of her most filthy Bargaine\r\n\r\n   Oth. Hah?\r\nAemil. Do thy worst:\r\nThis deede of thine is no more worthy Heauen,\r\nThen thou was't worthy her\r\n\r\n   Oth. Peace, you were best.\r\nAemil. Thou hast not halfe that powre to do me harm,\r\nAs I haue to be hurt. Oh Gull, oh dolt,\r\nAs ignorant as durt: thou hast done a deed\r\n(I care not for thy Sword) Ile make thee known,\r\nThough I lost twenty liues. Helpe, helpe, hoa, helpe:\r\nThe Moore hath kill'd my Mistris. Murther, murther.\r\nEnter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago.\r\n\r\n  Mon. What is the matter? How now Generall?\r\nAemil. Oh, are you come, Iago: you haue done well,\r\nThat men must lay their Murthers on your necke\r\n\r\n   Gra. What is the matter?\r\nAemil. Disproue this Villaine, if thou bee'st a man:\r\nHe sayes, thou told'st him that his wife was false:\r\nI know thou did'st not: thou'rt not such a Villain.\r\nSpeake, for my heart is full\r\n\r\n   Iago. I told him what I thought,\r\nAnd told no more\r\nThen what he found himselfe was apt, and true.\r\nAemil. But did you euer tell him,\r\nShe was false?\r\n  Iago. I did.\r\nAemil. You told a Lye an odious damned Lye:\r\nVpon my Soule, a Lye; a wicked Lye.\r\nShee false with Cassio?\r\nDid you say with Cassio?\r\n  Iago. With Cassio, Mistris?\r\nGo too, charme your tongue\r\n\r\n   Emil. I will not charme my Tongue;\r\nI am bound to speake,\r\nMy Mistris heere lyes murthered in her bed\r\n\r\n   All. Oh Heauens, forefend\r\n\r\n   Emil. And your reports haue set the Murder on\r\n\r\n   Othello. Nay stare not Masters,\r\nIt is true indeede\r\n\r\n   Gra. 'Tis a strange Truth\r\n\r\n   Mont. O monstrous Acte\r\n\r\n   Emil. Villany, villany, villany:\r\nI thinke vpon't, I thinke: I smel't: O Villany:\r\nI thought so then: Ile kill my selfe for greefe.\r\nO villany! villany!\r\n  Iago. What, are you mad?\r\nI charge you get you home\r\n\r\n   Emil. Good Gentlemen, let me haue leaue to speake:\r\n'Tis proper I obey him; but not now:\r\nPerchance Iago, I will ne're go home\r\n\r\n   Oth. Oh, oh, oh\r\n\r\n   Emil. Nay, lay thee downe, and roare:\r\nFor thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent,\r\nThat ere did lift vp eye\r\n\r\n   Oth. Oh she was fowle!\r\nI scarse did know you Vnkle, there lies your Neece,\r\nWhose breath (indeed) these hands haue newly stopp'd:\r\nI know this acte shewes horrible and grim\r\n\r\n   Gra. Poore Desdemon:\r\nI am glad thy Father's dead,\r\nThy Match was mortall to him: and pure greefe\r\nShore his old thred in twaine. Did he liue now,\r\nThis sight would make him do a desperate turne:\r\nYea, curse his better Angell from his side,\r\nAnd fall to Reprobance\r\n\r\n   Oth. 'Tis pittifull: but yet Iago knowes\r\nThat she with Cassio, hath the Act of shame\r\nA thousand times committed. Cassio confest it,\r\nAnd she did gratifie his amorous workes\r\nWith that Recognizance and pledge of Loue\r\nWhich I first gaue her: I saw it in his hand:\r\nIt was a Handkerchiefe, an Antique Token\r\nMy Father gaue my Mother\r\n\r\n   Emil. Oh Heauen! oh heauenly Powres!\r\n  Iago. Come, hold your peace\r\n\r\n   Emil. 'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace?\r\nNo, I will speake as liberall as the North;\r\nLet Heauen, and Men, and Diuels, let them all,\r\nAll, all, crie shame against me, yet Ile speake\r\n\r\n   Iago. Be wise, and get you home\r\n\r\n   Emil. I will not\r\n\r\n   Gra. Fye, your Sword vpon a Woman\r\n\r\n   Emil. Oh thou dull Moore,\r\nThat Handkerchiefe thou speak'st of\r\nI found by Fortune, and did giue my Husband:\r\nFor often, with a solemne earnestnesse,\r\n(More then indeed belong'd to such a Trifle)\r\nHe begg'd of me, to steale't\r\n\r\n   Iago. Villanous Whore\r\n\r\n   Emil. She giue it Cassio? No, alas I found it,\r\nAnd I did giu't my Husband\r\n\r\n   Iago. Filth, thou lyest\r\n\r\n   Emil. By Heauen I do not, I do not Gentlemen:\r\nOh murd'rous Coxcombe, what should such a Foole\r\nDo with so good a wife?\r\n  Oth. Are there no stones in Heauen,\r\nBut what serues for the Thunder?\r\nPrecious Villaine\r\n\r\n   Gra. The woman falles:\r\nSure he hath kill'd his Wife\r\n\r\n   Emil. I, I: oh lay me by my Mistris side\r\n\r\n   Gra. Hee's gone, but his wife's kill'd\r\n\r\n   Mon. 'Tis a notorious Villain: take you this weapon\r\nWhich I haue recouer'd from the Moore:\r\nCome guard the doore without, let him not passe,\r\nBut kill him rather. Ile after that same villaine,\r\nFor 'tis a damned Slaue.\r\nEnter.\r\n\r\n  Oth. I am not valiant neither:\r\nBut euery Punie whipster gets my Sword.\r\nBut why should Honor out-liue Honesty?\r\nLet it go all.\r\nAemil. What did thy Song boad Lady?\r\nHearke, canst thou heare me? I will play the Swan,\r\nAnd dye in Musicke: Willough, Willough, Willough.\r\nMoore, she was chaste: She lou'd thee, cruell Moore,\r\nSo come my Soule to blisse, as I speake true:\r\nSo speaking as I thinke, alas, I dye\r\n\r\n   Oth. I haue another weapon in this Chamber,\r\nIt was a Sword of Spaine, the Ice brookes temper:\r\nOh heere it is: Vnkle I must come forth\r\n\r\n   Gra. If thou attempt it, it will cost thee deere;\r\nThou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer\r\n\r\n   Oth. Looke in vpon me then, and speake with me,\r\nOr naked as I am I will assault thee\r\n\r\n   Gra. What is the matter?\r\n  Othel. Behold, I haue a weapon:\r\nA better neuer did it selfe sustaine\r\nVpon a Soldiers Thigh. I haue seene the day,\r\nThat with this little Arme, and this good Sword,\r\nI haue made my way through more impediments\r\nThen twenty times your stop. But (oh vaine boast)\r\nWho can controll his Fate? 'Tis not so now.\r\nBe not affraid, though you do see me weapon'd:\r\nHeere is my iournies end, heere is my butt\r\nAnd verie Sea-marke of my vtmost Saile.\r\nDo you go backe dismaid? 'Tis a lost feare:\r\nMan but a Rush against Othello's brest,\r\nAnd he retires. Where should Othello go?\r\nNow: how dost thou looke now? Oh ill-Starr'd wench,\r\nPale as thy Smocke: when we shall meete at compt,\r\nThis looke of thine will hurle my Soule from Heauen,\r\nAnd Fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my Girle?\r\nEuen like thy Chastity. O cursed, cursed Slaue!\r\nWhip me ye Diuels,\r\nFrom the possession of this Heauenly sight:\r\nBlow me about in windes, roast me in Sulphure,\r\nWash me in steepe-downe gulfes of Liquid fire.\r\nOh Desdemon! dead Desdemon: dead. Oh, oh!\r\nEnter Lodouico, Cassio, Montano, and Iago, with Officers.\r\n\r\n  Lod. Where is this rash, and most vnfortunate man?\r\n  Oth. That's he that was Othello: heere I am\r\n\r\n   Lod. Where is that Viper?\r\nBring the Villaine forth\r\n\r\n   Oth. I look down towards his feet; but that's a Fable,\r\nIf that thou bee'st a Diuell, I cannot kill thee\r\n\r\n   Lod. Wrench his Sword from him\r\n\r\n   Iago. I bleed Sir, but not kill'd\r\n\r\n   Othel. I am not sorry neither, Il'd haue thee liue:\r\nFor in my sense, 'tis happinesse to die\r\n\r\n   Lod. Oh thou Othello, that was once so good,\r\nFalne in the practise of a cursed Slaue,\r\nWhat shall be saide to thee\r\n\r\n   Oth. Why any thing:\r\nAn honourable Murderer, if you will:\r\nFor nought I did in hate, but all in Honour\r\n\r\n   Lod. This wretch hath part confest his Villany:\r\nDid you and he consent in Cassio's death\r\n\r\n   Oth. I\r\n\r\n   Cas. Deere Generall, I neuer gaue you cause\r\n\r\n   Oth. I do beleeue it, and I aske your pardon:\r\nWill you, I pray, demand that demy-Diuell,\r\nWhy he hath thus ensnar'd my Soule and Body\r\n\r\n   Iag. Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:\r\nFrom this time forth, I neuer will speake word\r\n\r\n   Lod. What? not to pray?\r\n  Gra. Torments will ope your lips\r\n\r\n   Oth. Well, thou dost best\r\n\r\n   Lod. Sir,\r\nYou shall vnderstand what hath befalne,\r\n(Which, as I thinke, you know not) heere is a Letter\r\nFound in the pocket of the slaine Rodorigo,\r\nAnd heere another, the one of them imports\r\nThe death of Cassio, to be vndertooke\r\nBy Rodorigo\r\n\r\n   Oth. O Villaine!\r\n  Cassio. Most Heathenish, and most grosse\r\n\r\n   Lod. Now, heere's another discontented paper\r\nFound in his pocket too: and this it seemes\r\nRodorigo meant t'haue sent this damned villaine:\r\nBut that (belike) Iago in the interim\r\nCame in, and satisfi'd him\r\n\r\n   Oth. Oh thou pernitious Caitiffe;\r\nHow came you (Cassio) by that Handkerchiefe\r\nThat was my wiues?\r\n  Cassio. I found it in my Chamber:\r\nAnd he himselfe confest it but euen now,\r\nThat there he dropt it for a speciall purpose,\r\nWhich wrought to his desire\r\n\r\n   Othel. O Foole, foole, foole!\r\n  Cassio. There is besides, in Rodorigo's Letter,\r\nHow he vpbraides Iago, that he made him\r\nBraue me vpon the Watch: whereon it came\r\nThat I was cast: and euen but now he spake\r\n(After long seeming dead) Iago hurt him,\r\nIago set him on\r\n\r\n   Lod. You must forsake this roome, and go with vs:\r\nYour Power, and your Command is taken off,\r\nAnd Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this Slaue,\r\nIf there be any cunning Crueltie,\r\nThat can torment him much, and hold him long,\r\nIt shall be his. You shall close Prisoner rest,\r\nTill that the Nature of your fault be knowne\r\nTo the Venetian State. Come, bring away\r\n\r\n   Oth. Soft you; a word or two before you goe:\r\nI haue done the State some seruice, and they know't:\r\nNo more of that. I pray you in your Letters,\r\nWhen you shall these vnluckie deeds relate,\r\nSpeake of me, as I am. Nothing extenuate,\r\nNor set downe ought in malice.\r\nThen must you speake,\r\nOf one that lou'd not wisely, but too well:\r\nOf one, not easily Iealious, but being wrought,\r\nPerplexed in the extreame: Of one, whose hand\r\n(Like the base Iudean) threw a Pearle away\r\nRicher then all his Tribe: Of one, whose subdu'd Eyes,\r\nAlbeit vn-vsed to the melting moode,\r\nDrops teares as fast as the Arabian Trees\r\nTheir Medicinable gumme. Set you downe this:\r\nAnd say besides, that in Aleppo once,\r\nWhere a malignant, and a Turbond-Turke\r\nBeate a Venetian, and traduc'd the State,\r\nI tooke by th' throat the circumcised Dogge,\r\nAnd smoate him, thus\r\n\r\n   Lod. Oh bloody period\r\n\r\n   Gra. All that is spoke, is marr'd\r\n\r\n   Oth. I kist thee, ere I kill'd thee: No way but this,\r\nKilling my selfe, to dye vpon a kisse.\r\n\r\nDyes\r\n\r\n  Cas. This did I feare, but thought he had no weapon:\r\nFor he was great of heart\r\n\r\n   Lod.

SCENE I.\r\nRome. A street.\r\n\r\nEnter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners.\r\n\r\n  FLAVIUS. Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.\r\n    Is this a holiday? What, know you not,\r\n    Being mechanical, you ought not walk\r\n    Upon a laboring day without the sign\r\n    Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?\r\n  FIRST COMMONER. Why, sir, a carpenter.\r\n  MARULLUS. Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?\r\n    What dost thou with thy best apparel on?\r\n    You, sir, what trade are you?\r\n  SECOND COMMONER. Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am\r\n    but, as you would say, a cobbler.\r\n  MARULLUS. But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.\r\n  SECOND COMMONER. A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a\r\nsafe\r\n    conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.\r\n  MARULLUS. What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what\r\ntrade?\r\n  SECOND COMMONER. Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me;\r\nyet,\r\n    if you be out, sir, I can mend you.\r\n  MARULLUS. What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy\r\nfellow!\r\n  SECOND COMMONER. Why, sir, cobble you.\r\n  FLAVIUS. Thou art a cobbler, art thou?\r\n  SECOND COMMONER. Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the\r\nawl; I\r\n    meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but\r\nwith\r\n    awl. I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are\r\nin\r\n    great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon\r\n    neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.\r\n  FLAVIUS. But wherefore art not in thy shop today?\r\n    Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?\r\n  SECOND COMMONER. Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get\r\nmyself\r\n    into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see\r\nCaesar\r\n    and to rejoice in his triumph.\r\n  MARULLUS. Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?\r\n    What tributaries follow him to Rome\r\n    To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?\r\n    You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!\r\n    O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,\r\n    Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft\r\n    Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,\r\n    To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,\r\n    Your infants in your arms, and there have sat\r\n    The livelong day with patient expectation\r\n    To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.\r\n    And when you saw his chariot but appear,\r\n    Have you not made an universal shout\r\n    That Tiber trembled underneath her banks\r\n    To hear the replication of your sounds\r\n    Made in her concave shores?\r\n    And do you now put on your best attire?\r\n    And do you now cull out a holiday?\r\n    And do you now strew flowers in his way\r\n    That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?\r\n    Be gone!\r\n    Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,\r\n    Pray to the gods to intermit the plague\r\n    That needs must light on this ingratitude.\r\n  FLAVIUS. Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,\r\n    Assemble all the poor men of your sort,\r\n    Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears\r\n    Into the channel, till the lowest stream\r\n    Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.\r\n                                           Exeunt all Commoners.\r\n    See whether their basest metal be not moved;\r\n    They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.\r\n    Go you down that way towards the Capitol;\r\n    This way will I. Disrobe the images\r\n    If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.\r\n  MARULLUS. May we do so?\r\n    You know it is the feast of Lupercal.\r\n  FLAVIUS. It is no matter; let no images\r\n    Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about\r\n    And drive away the vulgar from the streets;\r\n    So do you too, where you perceive them thick.\r\n    These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing\r\n    Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,\r\n    Who else would soar above the view of men\r\n    And keep us all in servile fearfulness.              Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\nA public place.\r\n\r\nFlourish. Enter Caesar; Antony, for the course; Calpurnia,\r\nPortia,\r\nDecius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and Casca; a great crowd\r\nfollows,\r\namong them a Soothsayer.\r\n\r\n  CAESAR. Calpurnia!\r\n  CASCA. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.\r\n                                                   Music ceases.\r\n  CAESAR. Calpurnia!\r\n  CALPURNIA. Here, my lord.\r\n  CAESAR. Stand you directly in Antonio's way,\r\n    When he doth run his course. Antonio!\r\n  ANTONY. Caesar, my lord?\r\n  CAESAR. Forget not in your speed, Antonio,\r\n    To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say\r\n    The barren, touched in this holy chase,\r\n    Shake off their sterile curse.\r\n  ANTONY. I shall remember.\r\n    When Caesar says \"Do this,\" it is perform'd.\r\n  CAESAR. Set on, and leave no ceremony out.           Flourish.\r\n  SOOTHSAYER. Caesar!\r\n  CAESAR. Ha! Who calls?\r\n  CASCA. Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!\r\n  CAESAR. Who is it in the press that calls on me?\r\n    I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,\r\n    Cry \"Caesar.\" Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.\r\n  SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.\r\n  CAESAR. What man is that?\r\n  BRUTUS. A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.\r\n  CAESAR. Set him before me let me see his face.\r\n  CASSIUS. Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.\r\n  CAESAR. What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.\r\n  SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.\r\n  CAESAR. He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.\r\n                      Sennet. Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius.\r\n  CASSIUS. Will you go see the order of the course?\r\n  BRUTUS. Not I.\r\n  CASSIUS. I pray you, do.\r\n  BRUTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part\r\n    Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.\r\n    Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;\r\n    I'll leave you.\r\n  CASSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;\r\n    I have not from your eyes that gentleness\r\n    And show of love as I was wont to have;\r\n    You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand\r\n    Over your friend that loves you.\r\n  BRUTUS. Cassius,\r\n    Be not deceived; if I have veil'd my look,\r\n    I turn the trouble of my countenance\r\n    Merely upon myself. Vexed I am\r\n    Of late with passions of some difference,\r\n    Conceptions only proper to myself,\r\n    Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;\r\n    But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-\r\n    Among which number, Cassius, be you one-\r\n    Nor construe any further my neglect\r\n    Than that poor Brutus with himself at war\r\n    Forgets the shows of love to other men.\r\n  CASSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,\r\n    By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried\r\n    Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.\r\n    Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?\r\n  BRUTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself\r\n    But by reflection, by some other things.\r\n  CASSIUS. 'Tis just,\r\n    And it is very much lamented, Brutus,\r\n    That you have no such mirrors as will turn\r\n    Your hidden worthiness into your eye\r\n    That you might see your shadow. I have heard\r\n    Where many of the best respect in Rome,\r\n    Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus\r\n    And groaning underneath this age's yoke,\r\n    Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.\r\n  BRUTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,\r\n    That you would have me seek into myself\r\n    For that which is not in me?\r\n  CASSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,\r\n    And since you know you cannot see yourself\r\n    So well as by reflection, I your glass\r\n    Will modestly discover to yourself\r\n    That of yourself which you yet know not of.\r\n    And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;\r\n    Were I a common laugher, or did use\r\n    To stale with ordinary oaths my love\r\n    To every new protester, if you know\r\n    That I do fawn on men and hug them hard\r\n    And after scandal them, or if you know\r\n    That I profess myself in banqueting\r\n    To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.\r\n                                             Flourish and shout.\r\n  BRUTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people\r\n    Choose Caesar for their king.\r\n  CASSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?\r\n    Then must I think you would not have it so.\r\n  BRUTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.\r\n    But wherefore do you hold me here so long?\r\n    What is it that you would impart to me?\r\n    If it be aught toward the general good,\r\n    Set honor in one eye and death i' the other\r\n    And I will look on both indifferently.\r\n    For let the gods so speed me as I love\r\n    The name of honor more than I fear death.\r\n  CASSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,\r\n    As well as I do know your outward favor.\r\n    Well, honor is the subject of my story.\r\n    I cannot tell what you and other men\r\n    Think of this life, but, for my single self,\r\n    I had as lief not be as live to be\r\n    In awe of such a thing as I myself.\r\n    I was born free as Caesar, so were you;\r\n    We both have fed as well, and we can both\r\n    Endure the winter's cold as well as he.\r\n    For once, upon a raw and gusty day,\r\n    The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,\r\n    Caesar said to me, \"Darest thou, Cassius, now\r\n    Leap in with me into this angry flood\r\n    And swim to yonder point?\" Upon the word,\r\n    Accoutred as I was, I plunged in\r\n    And bade him follow. So indeed he did.\r\n    The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it\r\n    With lusty sinews, throwing it aside\r\n    And stemming it with hearts of controversy.\r\n    But ere we could arrive the point proposed,\r\n    Caesar cried, \"Help me, Cassius, or I sink!\r\n    I, as Aeneas our great ancestor\r\n    Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder\r\n    The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber\r\n    Did I the tired Caesar. And this man\r\n    Is now become a god, and Cassius is\r\n    A wretched creature and must bend his body\r\n    If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.\r\n    He had a fever when he was in Spain,\r\n    And when the fit was on him I did mark\r\n    How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake;\r\n    His coward lips did from their color fly,\r\n    And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world\r\n    Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.\r\n    Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans\r\n    Mark him and write his speeches in their books,\r\n    Alas, it cried, \"Give me some drink, Titinius,\"\r\n    As a sick girl. Ye gods! It doth amaze me\r\n    A man of such a feeble temper should\r\n    So get the start of the majestic world\r\n    And bear the palm alone. Shout.                    Flourish.\r\n  BRUTUS. Another general shout!\r\n    I do believe that these applauses are\r\n    For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.\r\n  CASSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\r\n    Like a Colossus, and we petty men\r\n    Walk under his huge legs and peep about\r\n    To find ourselves dishonorable graves.\r\n    Men at some time are masters of their fates:\r\n    The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\r\n    But in ourselves that we are underlings.\r\n    Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that \"Caesar\"?\r\n    Why should that name be sounded more than yours?\r\n    Write them together, yours is as fair a name;\r\n    Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;\r\n    Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,\r\n    \"Brutus\" will start a spirit as soon as \"Caesar.\"\r\n    Now, in the names of all the gods at once,\r\n    Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed\r\n    That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!\r\n    Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!\r\n    When went there by an age since the great flood\r\n    But it was famed with more than with one man?\r\n    When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome\r\n    That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?\r\n    Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,\r\n    When there is in it but one only man.\r\n    O, you and I have heard our fathers say\r\n    There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd\r\n    The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome\r\n    As easily as a king.\r\n  BRUTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;\r\n    What you would work me to, I have some aim.\r\n    How I have thought of this and of these times,\r\n    I shall recount hereafter; for this present,\r\n    I would not, so with love I might entreat you,\r\n    Be any further moved. What you have said\r\n    I will consider; what you have to say\r\n    I will with patience hear, and find a time\r\n    Both meet to hear and answer such high things.\r\n    Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:\r\n    Brutus had rather be a villager\r\n    Than to repute himself a son of Rome\r\n    Under these hard conditions as this time\r\n    Is like to lay upon us.\r\n  CASSIUS. I am glad that my weak words\r\n    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.\r\n\r\n            Re-enter Caesar and his Train.\r\n\r\n  BRUTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.\r\n  CASSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,\r\n    And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you\r\n    What hath proceeded worthy note today.\r\n  BRUTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,\r\n    The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,\r\n    And all the rest look like a chidden train:\r\n    Calpurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero\r\n    Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes\r\n    As we have seen him in the Capitol,\r\n    Being cross'd in conference by some senators.\r\n  CASSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.\r\n  CAESAR. Antonio!\r\n  ANTONY. Caesar?\r\n  CAESAR. Let me have men about me that are fat,\r\n    Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:\r\n    Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;\r\n    He thinks too much; such men are dangerous.\r\n  ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;\r\n    He is a noble Roman and well given.\r\n  CAESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,\r\n    Yet if my name were liable to fear,\r\n    I do not know the man I should avoid\r\n    So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,\r\n    He is a great observer, and he looks\r\n    Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,\r\n    As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;\r\n    Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort\r\n    As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit\r\n    That could be moved to smile at anything.\r\n    Such men as he be never at heart's ease\r\n    Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,\r\n    And therefore are they very dangerous.\r\n    I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd\r\n    Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.\r\n    Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,\r\n    And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.\r\n              Sennet. Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca.\r\n  CASCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?\r\n  BRUTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today\r\n    That Caesar looks so sad.\r\n  CASCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?\r\n  BRUTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.\r\n  CASCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered\r\nhim,\r\n     he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the\r\n     people fell ashouting.\r\n  BRUTUS. What was the second noise for?\r\n  CASCA. Why, for that too.\r\n  CASSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?\r\n  CASCA. Why, for that too.\r\n  BRUTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?\r\n  CASCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time\r\ngentler\r\n    than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbors\r\n    shouted.\r\n  CASSIUS. Who offered him the crown?\r\n  CASCA. Why, Antony.\r\n  BRUTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\r\n  CASCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was\r\n    mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him\r\na\r\n    crown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these\r\n    coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once. But for all\r\n    that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he\r\noffered\r\n    it to him again; then he put it by again. But, to my\r\nthinking, he\r\n    was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered\r\nit\r\n    the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he\r\n    refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped\r\nhands\r\n    and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal\r\nof\r\n    stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had\r\n    almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it.\r\nAnd\r\n    for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my\r\nlips\r\n    and receiving the bad air.\r\n  CASSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?\r\n  CASCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and\r\nwas\r\n    speechless.\r\n  BRUTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.\r\n  CASSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,\r\n    And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.\r\n  CASCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar\r\nfell\r\n    down. If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him\r\n    according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to\r\ndo\r\n    the players in the theatre, I am no true man.\r\n  BRUTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?\r\n  CASCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common\r\n    herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his\r\ndoublet\r\n    and offered them his throat to cut. An had been a man of any\r\n    occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would\r\nI\r\n    might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he\r\ncame\r\n    to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything\r\namiss,\r\n    he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.\r\nThree or\r\n    four wenches where I stood cried, \"Alas, good soul!\" and\r\nforgave\r\n    him with all their hearts. But there's no heed to be taken of\r\n    them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have\r\ndone\r\n    no less.\r\n  BRUTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?\r\n  CASCA. Ay.\r\n  CASSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?\r\n  CASCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.\r\n  CASSIUS. To what effect?\r\n  CASCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face\r\n    again; but those that understood him smiled at one another\r\nand\r\n    shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me.\r\nI\r\n    could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for\r\npulling\r\n    scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you\r\nwell.\r\n    There was more foolery yet, if could remember it.\r\n  CASSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?\r\n  CASCA. No, I am promised forth.\r\n  CASSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?\r\n  CASCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner\r\nworth\r\n    the eating.\r\n  CASSIUS. Good, I will expect you.\r\n  CASCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.\r\n  BRUTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!\r\n    He was quick mettle when he went to school.\r\n  CASSIUS. So is he now in execution\r\n    Of any bold or noble enterprise,\r\n    However he puts on this tardy form.\r\n    This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,\r\n    Which gives men stomach to digest his words\r\n    With better appetite.\r\n  BRUTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.\r\n    Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,\r\n    I will come home to you, or, if you will,\r\n    Come home to me and I will wait for you.\r\n  CASSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.\r\n                                                    Exit Brutus.\r\n    Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see\r\n    Thy honorable mettle may be wrought\r\n    From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet\r\n    That noble minds keep ever with their likes;\r\n    For who so firm that cannot be seduced?\r\n    Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.\r\n    If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,\r\n    He should not humor me. I will this night,\r\n    In several hands, in at his windows throw,\r\n    As if they came from several citizens,\r\n    Writings, all tending to the great opinion\r\n    That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely\r\n    Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.\r\n    And after this let Caesar seat him sure;\r\n    For we will shake him, or worse days endure.           Exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\nA street. Thunder and lightning.\r\n\r\nEnter, from opposite sides, Casca, with his sword drawn, and\r\nCicero.\r\n\r\n  CICERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?\r\n    Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?\r\n  CASCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth\r\n    Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,\r\n    I have seen tempests when the scolding winds\r\n    Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen\r\n    The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam\r\n    To be exalted with the threatening clouds,\r\n    But never till tonight, never till now,\r\n    Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.\r\n    Either there is a civil strife in heaven,\r\n    Or else the world too saucy with the gods\r\n    Incenses them to send destruction.\r\n  CICERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?\r\n  CASCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-\r\n    Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn\r\n    Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand\r\n    Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.\r\n    Besides- I ha' not since put up my sword-\r\n    Against the Capitol I met a lion,\r\n    Who glaz'd upon me and went surly by\r\n    Without annoying me. And there were drawn\r\n    Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women\r\n    Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw\r\n    Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.\r\n    And yesterday the bird of night did sit\r\n    Even at noonday upon the marketplace,\r\n    Howling and shrieking. When these prodigies\r\n    Do so conjointly meet, let not men say\r\n    \"These are their reasons; they are natural\":\r\n    For I believe they are portentous things\r\n    Unto the climate that they point upon.\r\n  CICERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.\r\n    But men may construe things after their fashion,\r\n    Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.\r\n    Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?\r\n  CASCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio\r\n    Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.\r\n  CICERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky\r\n    Is not to walk in.\r\n  CASCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.\r\n\r\n                        Enter Cassius.\r\n\r\n  CASSIUS. Who's there?\r\n  CASCA. A Roman.\r\n  CASSIUS. Casca, by your voice.\r\n  CASCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!\r\n  CASSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.\r\n  CASCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?\r\n  CASSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.\r\n    For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,\r\n    Submitting me unto the perilous night,\r\n    And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,\r\n    Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;\r\n    And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open\r\n    The breast of heaven, I did present myself\r\n    Even in the aim and very flash of it.\r\n  CASCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?\r\n    It is the part of men to fear and tremble\r\n    When the most mighty gods by tokens send\r\n    Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.\r\n  CASSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life\r\n    That should be in a Roman you do want,\r\n    Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze\r\n    And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder\r\n    To see the strange impatience of the heavens.\r\n    But if you would consider the true cause\r\n    Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,\r\n    Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,\r\n    Why old men, fools, and children calculate,\r\n    Why all these things change from their ordinance,\r\n    Their natures, and preformed faculties\r\n    To monstrous quality, why, you shall find\r\n    That heaven hath infused them with these spirits\r\n    To make them instruments of fear and warning\r\n    Unto some monstrous state.\r\n    Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man\r\n    Most like this dreadful night,\r\n    That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars\r\n    As doth the lion in the Capitol,\r\n    A man no mightier than thyself or me\r\n    In personal action, yet prodigious grown\r\n    And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.\r\n  CASCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?\r\n  CASSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now\r\n    Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.\r\n    But, woe the while! Our fathers' minds are dead,\r\n    And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;\r\n    Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.\r\n  CASCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow\r\n    Mean to establish Caesar as a king,\r\n    And he shall wear his crown by sea and land\r\n    In every place save here in Italy.\r\n  CASSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:\r\n    Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.\r\n    Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;\r\n    Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.\r\n    Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,\r\n    Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron\r\n    Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;\r\n    But life, being weary of these worldly bars,\r\n    Never lacks power to dismiss itself.\r\n    If I know this, know all the world besides,\r\n    That part of tyranny that I do bear\r\n    I can shake off at pleasure.                  Thunder still.\r\n  CASCA. So can I.\r\n    So every bondman in his own hand bears\r\n    The power to cancel his captivity.\r\n  CASSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?\r\n    Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf\r\n    But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.\r\n    He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.\r\n    Those that with haste will make a mighty fire\r\n    Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,\r\n    What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves\r\n    For the base matter to illuminate\r\n    So vile a thing as Caesar? But, O grief,\r\n    Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this\r\n    Before a willing bondman; then I know\r\n    My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,\r\n    And dangers are to me indifferent.\r\n  CASCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man\r\n    That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand.\r\n    Be factious for redress of all these griefs,\r\n    And I will set this foot of mine as far\r\n    As who goes farthest.\r\n  CASSIUS. There's a bargain made.\r\n    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already\r\n    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans\r\n    To undergo with me an enterprise\r\n    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;\r\n    And I do know by this, they stay for me\r\n    In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,\r\n    There is no stir or walking in the streets,\r\n    And the complexion of the element\r\n    In favor's like the work we have in hand,\r\n    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.\r\n\r\n                       Enter Cinna.\r\n\r\n  CASCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.\r\n  CASSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;\r\n    He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?\r\n  CINNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?\r\n  CASSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate\r\n    To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?\r\n  CINNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!\r\n    There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.\r\n  CASSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.\r\n  CINNA. Yes, you are.\r\n    O Cassius, if you could\r\n    But win the noble Brutus to our party-\r\n  CASSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,\r\n    And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,\r\n    Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this\r\n    In at his window; set this up with wax\r\n    Upon old Brutus' statue. All this done,\r\n    Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.\r\n    Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?\r\n  CINNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone\r\n    To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie\r\n    And so bestow these papers as you bade me.\r\n  CASSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.\r\n                                                     Exit Cinna.\r\n    Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day\r\n    See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him\r\n    Is ours already, and the man entire\r\n    Upon the next encounter yields him ours.\r\n  CASCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,\r\n    And that which would appear offense in us,\r\n    His countenance, like richest alchemy,\r\n    Will change to virtue and to worthiness.\r\n  CASSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him\r\n    You have right well conceited. Let us go,\r\n    For it is after midnight, and ere day\r\n    We will awake him and be sure of him.                Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

What, Lucius, ho!\r\n    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,\r\n    Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!\r\n    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.\r\n    When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!\r\n\r\n                            Enter Lucius.\r\n\r\n  LUCIUS. Call'd you, my lord?\r\n  BRUTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.\r\n    When it is lighted, come and call me here.\r\n  LUCIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.\r\n  BRUTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,\r\n    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,\r\n    But for the general. He would be crown'd:\r\n    How that might change his nature, there's the question.\r\n    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder\r\n    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,\r\n    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him\r\n    That at his will he may do danger with.\r\n    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins\r\n    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,\r\n    I have not known when his affections sway'd\r\n    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof\r\n    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,\r\n    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;\r\n    But when he once attains the upmost round,\r\n    He then unto the ladder turns his back,\r\n    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\r\n    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;\r\n    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel\r\n    Will bear no color for the thing he is,\r\n    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,\r\n    Would run to these and these extremities;\r\n    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg\r\n    Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,\r\n    And kill him in the shell.\r\n\r\n                        Re-enter Lucius.\r\n\r\n  LUCIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.\r\n    Searching the window for a flint I found\r\n    This paper thus seal'd up, and I am sure\r\n    It did not lie there when I went to bed.\r\n                                           Gives him the letter.\r\n  BRUTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.\r\n    Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?\r\n  LUCIUS. I know not, sir.\r\n  BRUTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.\r\n  LUCIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.\r\n  BRUTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air\r\n    Give so much light that I may read by them.\r\n                                     Opens the letter and reads.\r\n    \"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!\r\n    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!\"\r\n    Such instigations have been often dropp'd\r\n    Where I have took them up.\r\n    \"Shall Rome, etc.\" Thus must I piece it out.\r\n    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?\r\n    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome\r\n    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.\r\n    \"Speak, strike, redress!\" Am I entreated\r\n    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,\r\n    If the redress will follow, thou receivest\r\n    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!\r\n\r\n                        Re-enter Lucius.\r\n\r\n  LUCIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.\r\n                                                Knocking within.\r\n  BRUTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.\r\n                                                    Exit Lucius.\r\n    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar\r\n    I have not slept.\r\n    Between the acting of a dreadful thing\r\n    And the first motion, all the interim is\r\n    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;\r\n    The genius and the mortal instruments\r\n    Are then in council, and the state of man,\r\n    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then\r\n    The nature of an insurrection.\r\n\r\n                         Re-enter Lucius.\r\n\r\n  LUCIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,\r\n    Who doth desire to see you.\r\n  BRUTUS. Is he alone?\r\n  LUCIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.\r\n  BRUTUS. Do you know them?\r\n  LUCIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,\r\n    And half their faces buried in their cloaks,\r\n    That by no means I may discover them\r\n    By any mark of favor.\r\n  BRUTUS. Let 'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.\r\n    They are the faction. O Conspiracy,\r\n    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,\r\n    When evils are most free? O, then, by day\r\n    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough\r\n    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;\r\n    Hide it in smiles and affability;\r\n    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,\r\n    Not Erebus itself were dim enough\r\n    To hide thee from prevention.\r\n\r\n    Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,\r\n                Metellus Cimber, and Trebonius.\r\n\r\n  CASSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.\r\n    Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?\r\n  BRUTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.\r\n    Know I these men that come along with you?\r\n  CASSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here\r\n    But honors you, and every one doth wish\r\n    You had but that opinion of yourself\r\n    Which every noble Roman bears of you.\r\n    This is Trebonius.\r\n  BRUTUS. He is welcome hither.\r\n  CASSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.\r\n  BRUTUS. He is welcome too.\r\nCASSIUS. This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.\r\n  BRUTUS. They are all welcome.\r\n    What watchful cares do interpose themselves\r\n    Betwixt your eyes and night?\r\n  CASSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.\r\n  DECIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?\r\n  CASCA. No.\r\n  CINNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines\r\n    That fret the clouds are messengers of day.\r\n  CASCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.\r\n    Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,\r\n    Which is a great way growing on the south,\r\n    Weighing the youthful season of the year.\r\n    Some two months hence up higher toward the north\r\n    He first presents his fire, and the high east\r\n    Stands as the Capitol, directly here.\r\n  BRUTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.\r\n  CASSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.\r\n  BRUTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,\r\n    The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse-\r\n    If these be motives weak, break off betimes,\r\n    And every man hence to his idle bed;\r\n    So let high-sighted tyranny range on\r\n    Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,\r\n    As I am sure they do, bear fire enough\r\n    To kindle cowards and to steel with valor\r\n    The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,\r\n    What need we any spur but our own cause\r\n    To prick us to redress? What other bond\r\n    Than secret Romans that have spoke the word\r\n    And will not palter? And what other oath\r\n    Than honesty to honesty engaged\r\n    That this shall be or we will fall for it?\r\n    Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,\r\n    Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls\r\n    That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear\r\n    Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain\r\n    The even virtue of our enterprise,\r\n    Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,\r\n    To think that or our cause or our performance\r\n    Did need an oath; when every drop of blood\r\n    That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,\r\n    Is guilty of a several bastardy\r\n    If he do break the smallest particle\r\n    Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.\r\n  CASSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?\r\n    I think he will stand very strong with us.\r\n  CASCA. Let us not leave him out.\r\n  CINNA. No, by no means.\r\n  METELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs\r\n    Will purchase us a good opinion,\r\n    And buy men's voices to commend our deeds.\r\n    It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands;\r\n    Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,\r\n    But all be buried in his gravity.\r\n  BRUTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,\r\n    For he will never follow anything\r\n    That other men begin.\r\n  CASSIUS. Then leave him out.\r\n  CASCA. Indeed he is not fit.\r\n  DECIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?\r\n  CASSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet\r\n    Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,\r\n    Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him\r\n    A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,\r\n    If he improve them, may well stretch so far\r\n    As to annoy us all, which to prevent,\r\n    Let Antony and Caesar fall together.\r\n  BRUTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,\r\n    To cut the head off and then hack the limbs\r\n    Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;\r\n    For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.\r\n    Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.\r\n    We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,\r\n    And in the spirit of men there is no blood.\r\n    O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,\r\n    And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,\r\n    Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,\r\n    Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;\r\n    Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,\r\n    Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;\r\n    And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,\r\n    Stir up their servants to an act of rage\r\n    And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make\r\n    Our purpose necessary and not envious,\r\n    Which so appearing to the common eyes,\r\n    We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.\r\n    And for Mark Antony, think not of him,\r\n    For he can do no more than Caesar's arm\r\n    When Caesar's head is off.\r\n  CASSIUS. Yet I fear him,\r\n    For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar-\r\n  BRUTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.\r\n    If he love Caesar, all that he can do\r\n    Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar.\r\n    And that were much he should, for he is given\r\n    To sports, to wildness, and much company.\r\n  TREBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,\r\n    For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.\r\n                                                  Clock strikes.\r\n  BRUTUS. Peace, count the clock.\r\n  CASSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.\r\n  TREBONIUS. 'Tis time to part.\r\n  CASSIUS. But it is doubtful yet\r\n    Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,\r\n    For he is superstitious grown of late,\r\n    Quite from the main opinion he held once\r\n    Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.\r\n    It may be these apparent prodigies,\r\n    The unaccustom'd terror of this night,\r\n    And the persuasion of his augurers\r\n    May hold him from the Capitol today.\r\n  DECIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,\r\n    I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear\r\n    That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,\r\n    And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,\r\n    Lions with toils, and men with flatterers;\r\n    But when I tell him he hates flatterers,\r\n    He says he does, being then most flattered.\r\n    Let me work;\r\n    For I can give his humor the true bent,\r\n    And I will bring him to the Capitol.\r\n  CASSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.\r\n  BRUTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?\r\n  CINNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.\r\n  METELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,\r\n    Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.\r\n    I wonder none of you have thought of him.\r\n  BRUTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.\r\n    He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;\r\n    Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.\r\n  CASSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,\r\n    And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember\r\n    What you have said and show yourselves true Romans.\r\n  BRUTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;\r\n    Let not our looks put on our purposes,\r\n    But bear it as our Roman actors do,\r\n    With untired spirits and formal constancy.\r\n    And so, good morrow to you every one.\r\n                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.\r\n    Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.\r\n    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;\r\n    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,\r\n    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;\r\n    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.\r\n\r\n                           Enter Portia.\r\n\r\n  PORTIA. Brutus, my lord!\r\n  BRUTUS. Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?\r\n    It is not for your health thus to commit\r\n    Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.\r\n  PORTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,\r\n    Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper\r\n    You suddenly arose and walk'd about,\r\n    Musing and sighing, with your arms across;\r\n    And when I ask'd you what the matter was,\r\n    You stared upon me with ungentle looks.\r\n    I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,\r\n    And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot.\r\n    Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,\r\n    But with an angry waiter of your hand\r\n    Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,\r\n    Fearing to strengthen that impatience\r\n    Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal\r\n    Hoping it was but an effect of humor,\r\n    Which sometime hath his hour with every man.\r\n    It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,\r\n    And, could it work so much upon your shape\r\n    As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,\r\n    I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,\r\n    Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.\r\n  BRUTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.\r\n  PORTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,\r\n    He would embrace the means to come by it.\r\n  BRUTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.\r\n  PORTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical\r\n    To walk unbraced and suck up the humors\r\n    Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,\r\n    And will he steal out of his wholesome bed\r\n    To dare the vile contagion of the night\r\n    And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air\r\n    To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,\r\n    You have some sick offense within your mind,\r\n    Which by the right and virtue of my place\r\n    I ought to know of; and, upon my knees,\r\n    I charm you, by my once commended beauty,\r\n    By all your vows of love and that great vow\r\n    Which did incorporate and make us one,\r\n    That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,\r\n    Why you are heavy and what men tonight\r\n    Have had resort to you; for here have been\r\n    Some six or seven, who did hide their faces\r\n    Even from darkness.\r\n  BRUTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.\r\n  PORTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.\r\n    Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,\r\n    Is it excepted I should know no secrets\r\n    That appertain to you? Am I yourself\r\n    But, as it were, in sort or limitation,\r\n    To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,\r\n    And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs\r\n    Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,\r\n    Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.\r\n  BRUTUS. You are my true and honorable wife,\r\n    As dear to me as are the ruddy drops\r\n    That visit my sad heart.\r\n  PORTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret.\r\n    I grant I am a woman, but withal\r\n    A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.\r\n    I grant I am a woman, but withal\r\n    A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.\r\n    Think you I am no stronger than my sex,\r\n    Being so father'd and so husbanded?\r\n    Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em.\r\n    I have made strong proof of my constancy,\r\n    Giving myself a voluntary wound\r\n    Here in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience\r\n    And not my husband's secrets?\r\n  BRUTUS. O ye gods,\r\n    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.\r\n    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,\r\n    And by and by thy bosom shall partake\r\n    The secrets of my heart.\r\n    All my engagements I will construe to thee,\r\n    All the charactery of my sad brows.\r\n    Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that\r\nknocks?\r\n\r\n                  Re-enter Lucius with Ligarius.\r\n\r\n  LUCIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.\r\n  BRUTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.\r\n    Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?\r\n  LIGARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.\r\n  BRUTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,\r\n    To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!\r\n  LIGARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand\r\n    Any exploit worthy the name of honor.\r\n  BRUTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,\r\n    Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.\r\n  LIGARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,\r\n    I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!\r\n    Brave son, derived from honorable loins!\r\n    Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up\r\n    My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,\r\n    And I will strive with things impossible,\r\n    Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?\r\n  BRUTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.\r\n  LIGARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?\r\n  BRUTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,\r\n    I shall unfold to thee, as we are going\r\n    To whom it must be done.\r\n  LIGARIUS. Set on your foot,\r\n    And with a heart new-fired I follow you,\r\n    To do I know not what; but it sufficeth\r\n    That Brutus leads me on.\r\n  BRUTUS. Follow me then.                                Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\nCaesar's house. Thunder and lightning.\r\n\r\nEnter Caesar, in his nightgown.\r\n\r\n  CAESAR. Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.\r\n    Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,\r\n    \"Help, ho! They murther Caesar!\" Who's within?\r\n\r\n                         Enter a Servant.\r\n\r\n  SERVANT. My lord?\r\n  CAESAR. Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,\r\n    And bring me their opinions of success.\r\n  SERVANT. I will, my lord.                                Exit.\r\n\r\n                         Enter Calpurnia.\r\n\r\n  CALPURNIA. What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?\r\n    You shall not stir out of your house today.\r\n  CAESAR. Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me\r\n    Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see\r\n    The face of Caesar, they are vanished.\r\n  CALPURNIA. Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,\r\n    Yet now they fright me. There is one within,\r\n    Besides the things that we have heard and seen,\r\n    Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.\r\n    A lioness hath whelped in the streets;\r\n    And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;\r\n    Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds,\r\n    In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,\r\n    Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;\r\n    The noise of battle hurtled in the air,\r\n    Horses did neigh and dying men did groan,\r\n    And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.\r\n    O Caesar! These things are beyond all use,\r\n    And I do fear them.\r\n  CAESAR. What can be avoided\r\n    Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?\r\n    Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions\r\n    Are to the world in general as to Caesar.\r\n  CALPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;\r\n    The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.\r\n  CAESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;\r\n    The valiant never taste of death but once.\r\n    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,\r\n    It seems to me most strange that men should fear\r\n    Seeing that death, a necessary end,\r\n    Will come when it will come.\r\n\r\n                      Re-enter Servant.\r\n\r\n    What say the augurers?\r\n  SERVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today.\r\n    Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,\r\n    They could not find a heart within the beast.\r\n  CAESAR. The gods do this in shame of cowardice.\r\n    Caesar should be a beast without a heart\r\n    If he should stay at home today for fear.\r\n    No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well\r\n    That Caesar is more dangerous than he.\r\n    We are two lions litter'd in one day,\r\n    And I the elder and more terrible.\r\n    And Caesar shall go forth.\r\n  CALPURNIA. Alas, my lord,\r\n    Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.\r\n    Do not go forth today. Call it my fear\r\n    That keeps you in the house and not your own.\r\n    We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,\r\n    And he shall say you are not well today.\r\n    Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.\r\n  CAESAR. Mark Antony shall say I am not well,\r\n    And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.\r\n\r\n                        Enter Decius.\r\n\r\n    Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.\r\n  DECIUS. Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar!\r\n    I come to fetch you to the Senate House.\r\n  CAESAR. And you are come in very happy time\r\n    To bear my greeting to the senators\r\n    And tell them that I will not come today.\r\n    Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:\r\n    I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.\r\n  CALPURNIA. Say he is sick.\r\n  CAESAR. Shall Caesar send a lie?\r\n    Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far\r\n    To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?\r\n    Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.\r\n  DECIUS. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,\r\n    Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.\r\n  CAESAR. The cause is in my will: I will not come,\r\n    That is enough to satisfy the Senate.\r\n    But, for your private satisfaction,\r\n    Because I love you, I will let you know.\r\n    Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home;\r\n    She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,\r\n    Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,\r\n    Did run pure blood, and many lusty Romans\r\n    Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.\r\n    And these does she apply for warnings and portents\r\n    And evils imminent, and on her knee\r\n    Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today.\r\n  DECIUS. This dream is all amiss interpreted;\r\n    It was a vision fair and fortunate.\r\n    Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,\r\n    In which so many smiling Romans bathed,\r\n    Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck\r\n    Reviving blood, and that great men shall press\r\n    For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.\r\n    This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.\r\n  CAESAR. And this way have you well expounded it.\r\n  DECIUS. I have, when you have heard what I can say.\r\n    And know it now, the Senate have concluded\r\n    To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.\r\n    If you shall send them word you will not come,\r\n    Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock\r\n    Apt to be render'd, for someone to say\r\n    \"Break up the Senate till another time,\r\n    When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.\"\r\n    If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper\r\n    \"Lo, Caesar is afraid\"?\r\n    Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love\r\n    To your proceeding bids me tell you this,\r\n    And reason to my love is liable.\r\n  CAESAR. How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!\r\n    I am ashamed I did yield to them.\r\n    Give me my robe, for I will go.\r\n\r\n         Enter Publius, Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca,\r\n                     Trebonius, and Cinna.\r\n\r\n    And look where Publius is come to fetch me.\r\n  PUBLIUS. Good morrow,Caesar.\r\n  CAESAR. Welcome, Publius.\r\n    What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?\r\n    Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,\r\n    Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy\r\n    As that same ague which hath made you lean.\r\n    What is't o'clock?\r\n  BRUTUS. Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.\r\n  CAESAR. I thank you for your pains and courtesy.\r\n\r\n                           Enter Antony.\r\n\r\n    See, Antony, that revels long o' nights,\r\n    Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.\r\n  ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.\r\n  CAESAR. Bid them prepare within.\r\n    I am to blame to be thus waited for.\r\n    Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius,\r\n    I have an hour's talk in store for you;\r\n    Remember that you call on me today;\r\n    Be near me, that I may remember you.\r\n  TREBONIUS. Caesar, I will. [Aside.] And so near will I be\r\n    That your best friends shall wish I had been further.\r\n  CAESAR. Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,\r\n    And we like friends will straightway go together.\r\n  BRUTUS. [Aside.] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,\r\n    The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!            Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\nA street near the Capitol.\r\n\r\nEnter Artemidorus, reading paper.\r\n\r\n  ARTEMIDORUS. \"Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;\r\ncome\r\n    not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius;\r\nmark\r\n    well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast\r\n    wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these\r\nmen,\r\n    and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,\r\nlook\r\n    about you. Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods\r\n    defend thee!\r\n                                        Thy lover, Artemidorus.\"\r\n    Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,\r\n    And as a suitor will I give him this.\r\n    My heart laments that virtue cannot live\r\n    Out of the teeth of emulation.\r\n    If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;\r\n    If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.           Exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.\r\nAnother part of the same street, before the house of Brutus.\r\n\r\nEnter Portia and Lucius.\r\n\r\n  PORTIA. I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House;\r\n    Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.\r\n    Why dost thou stay?\r\n  LUCIUS. To know my errand, madam.\r\n  PORTIA. I would have had thee there, and here again,\r\n    Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.\r\n    O constancy, be strong upon my side!\r\n    Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!\r\n    I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.\r\n    How hard it is for women to keep counsel!\r\n    Art thou here yet?\r\n  LUCIUS. Madam, what should I do?\r\n    Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?\r\n    And so return to you, and nothing else?\r\n  PORTIA. Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,\r\n    For he went sickly forth; and take good note\r\n    What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.\r\n    Hark, boy, what noise is that?\r\n  LUCIUS. I hear none, madam.\r\n  PORTIA. Prithee, listen well.\r\n    I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,\r\n    And the wind brings it from the Capitol.\r\n  LUCIUS. Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.\r\n\r\n                     Enter the Soothsayer.\r\n\r\n  PORTIA. Come hither, fellow;\r\n    Which way hast thou been?\r\n  SOOTHSAYER. At mine own house, good lady.\r\n  PORTIA. What is't o'clock?\r\n  SOOTHSAYER. About the ninth hour, lady.\r\n  PORTIA. Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?\r\n  SOOTHSAYER. Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand\r\n    To see him pass on to the Capitol.\r\n  PORTIA. Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?\r\n  SOOTHSAYER. That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar\r\n    To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,\r\n    I shall beseech him to befriend himself.\r\n  PORTIA. Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?\r\n  SOOTHSAYER. None that I know will be, much that I fear may\r\nchance.\r\n    Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow,\r\n    The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,\r\n    Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,\r\n    Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.\r\n    I'll get me to a place more void and there\r\n    Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.               Exit.\r\n  PORTIA. I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing\r\n    The heart of woman is! O Brutus,\r\n    The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!\r\n    Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit\r\n    That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.\r\n    Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;\r\n    Say I am merry. Come to me again,\r\n    And bring me word what he doth say to thee.\r\n                                               Exeunt severally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.\r\nA crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.\r\n\r\nFlourish. Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus,\r\nTrebonius, Cinna, Antony, Lepidus, Popilius, Publius, and others.\r\n\r\n  CAESAR. The ides of March are come.\r\n  SOOTHSAYER. Ay, Caesar, but not gone.\r\n  A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.\r\n  DECIUS. Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read,\r\n    At your best leisure, this his humble suit.\r\n  ARTEMIDORUS. O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a suit\r\n    That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.\r\n  CAESAR. What touches us ourself shall be last served.\r\n  ARTEMIDORUS. Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.\r\n  CAESAR. What, is the fellow mad?\r\n  PUBLIUS. Sirrah, give place.\r\n  CASSIUS. What, urge you your petitions in the street?\r\n    Come to the Capitol.\r\n\r\n      Caesar goes up to the Senate House, the rest follow.\r\n\r\n  POPILIUS. I wish your enterprise today may thrive.\r\n  CASSIUS. What enterprise, Popilius?\r\n  POPILIUS. Fare you well.\r\n                                             Advances to Caesar.\r\n  BRUTUS. What said Popilius Lena?\r\n  CASSIUS. He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive.\r\n    I fear our purpose is discovered.\r\n  BRUTUS. Look, how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.\r\n  CASSIUS. Casca,\r\n    Be sudden, for we fear prevention.\r\n    Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,\r\n    Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,\r\n    For I will slay myself.\r\n  BRUTUS. Cassius, be constant.\r\n    Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;\r\n    For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.\r\n  CASSIUS. Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,\r\n    He draws Mark Antony out of the way.\r\n                                    Exeunt Antony and Trebonius.\r\n  DECIUS. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him\r\n    And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.\r\n  BRUTUS. He is address'd; press near and second him.\r\n  CINNA. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.\r\n  CAESAR. Are we all ready? What is now amiss\r\n    That Caesar and his Senate must redress?\r\n  METELLUS. Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,\r\n    Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat\r\n    An humble heart.                                     Kneels.\r\n  CAESAR. I must prevent thee, Cimber.\r\n    These couchings and these lowly courtesies\r\n    Might fire the blood of ordinary men\r\n    And turn preordinance and first decree\r\n    Into the law of children. Be not fond\r\n    To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood\r\n    That will be thaw'd from the true quality\r\n    With that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words,\r\n    Low-crooked court'sies, and base spaniel-fawning.\r\n    Thy brother by decree is banished.\r\n    If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,\r\n    I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.\r\n    Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause\r\n    Will he be satisfied.\r\n  METELLUS. Is there no voice more worthy than my own,\r\n    To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear\r\n    For the repealing of my banish'd brother?\r\n  BRUTUS. I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,\r\n    Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may\r\n    Have an immediate freedom of repeal.\r\n  CAESAR. What, Brutus?\r\n  CASSIUS. Pardon, Caesar! Caesar, pardon!\r\n    As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall\r\n    To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.\r\n  CAESAR. I could be well moved, if I were as you;\r\n    If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;\r\n    But I am constant as the northern star,\r\n    Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality\r\n    There is no fellow in the firmament.\r\n    The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks;\r\n    They are all fire and every one doth shine;\r\n    But there's but one in all doth hold his place.\r\n    So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,\r\n    And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;\r\n    Yet in the number I do know but one\r\n    That unassailable holds on his rank,\r\n    Unshaked of motion; and that I am he,\r\n    Let me a little show it, even in this;\r\n    That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,\r\n    And constant do remain to keep him so.\r\n  CINNA. O Caesar-\r\n  CAESAR. Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?\r\n  DECIUS. Great Caesar-\r\n  CAESAR. Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?\r\n  CASCA. Speak, hands, for me!\r\n                        Casca first, then the other Conspirators\r\n                                  and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar.\r\n  CAESAR. Et tu, Brute?- Then fall, Caesar! Dies.\r\n  CINNA. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!\r\n    Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.\r\n  CASSIUS. Some to the common pulpits and cry out\r\n    \"Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!\"\r\n  BRUTUS. People and senators, be not affrighted,\r\n    Fly not, stand still; ambition's debt is paid.\r\n  CASCA. Go to the pulpit, Brutus.\r\n  DECIUS. And Cassius too.\r\n  BRUTUS. Where's Publius?\r\n  CINNA. Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.\r\n  METELLUS. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's\r\n    Should chance-\r\n  BRUTUS. Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer,\r\n    There is no harm intended to your person,\r\n    Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.\r\n  CASSIUS. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people\r\n    Rushing on us should do your age some mischief.\r\n  BRUTUS. Do so, and let no man abide this deed\r\n    But we the doers.\r\n\r\n                        Re-enter Trebonius.\r\n\r\n  CASSIUS. Where is Antony?\r\n  TREBONIUS. Fled to his house amazed.\r\n    Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run\r\n    As it were doomsday.\r\n  BRUTUS. Fates, we will know your pleasures.\r\n    That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time\r\n    And drawing days out that men stand upon.\r\n  CASSIUS. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life\r\n    Cuts off so many years of fearing death.\r\n  BRUTUS. Grant that, and then is death a benefit;\r\n    So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged\r\n    His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,\r\n    And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood\r\n    Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords;\r\n    Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,\r\n    And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,\r\n    Let's all cry, \"Peace, freedom, and liberty!\"\r\n  CASSIUS. Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence\r\n    Shall this our lofty scene be acted over\r\n    In states unborn and accents yet unknown!\r\n  BRUTUS. How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,\r\n    That now on Pompey's basis lies along\r\n    No worthier than the dust!\r\n  CASSIUS. So oft as that shall be,\r\n    So often shall the knot of us be call'd\r\n    The men that gave their country liberty.\r\n  DECIUS. What, shall we forth?\r\n  CASSIUS. Ay, every man away.\r\n    Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels\r\n    With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.\r\n\r\n                        Enter a Servant.\r\n\r\n  BRUTUS. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony's.\r\n  SERVANT. Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,\r\n    Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,\r\n    And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:\r\n    Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;\r\n    Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.\r\n    Say I love Brutus and I honor him;\r\n    Say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.\r\n    If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony\r\n    May safely come to him and be resolved\r\n    How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,\r\n    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead\r\n    So well as Brutus living, but will follow\r\n    The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus\r\n    Thorough the hazards of this untrod state\r\n    With all true faith. So says my master Antony.\r\n  BRUTUS. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;\r\n    I never thought him worse.\r\n    Tell him, so please him come unto this place,\r\n    He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,\r\n    Depart untouch'd.\r\n  SERVANT. I'll fetch him presently.                       Exit.\r\n  BRUTUS. I know that we shall have him well to friend.\r\n  CASSIUS. I wish we may, but yet have I a mind\r\n    That fears him much, and my misgiving still\r\n    Falls shrewdly to the purpose.\r\n\r\n                          Re-enter Antony.\r\n\r\n  BRUTUS. But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.\r\n  ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?\r\n    Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,\r\n    Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.\r\n    I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,\r\n    Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.\r\n    If I myself, there is no hour so fit\r\n    As Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrument\r\n    Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich\r\n    With the most noble blood of all this world.\r\n    I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,\r\n    Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,\r\n    Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,\r\n    I shall not find myself so apt to die;\r\n    No place will please me so, no means of death,\r\n    As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,\r\n    The choice and master spirits of this age.\r\n  BRUTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us!\r\n    Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,\r\n    As, by our hands and this our present act\r\n    You see we do, yet see you but our hands\r\n    And this the bleeding business they have done.\r\n    Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;\r\n    And pity to the general wrong of Rome-\r\n    As fire drives out fire, so pity pity-\r\n    Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,\r\n    To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;\r\n    Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts\r\n    Of brothers' temper, do receive you in\r\n    With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.\r\n  CASSIUS. Your voice shall be as strong as any man's\r\n    In the disposing of new dignities.\r\n  BRUTUS. Only be patient till we have appeased\r\n    The multitude, beside themselves with fear,\r\n    And then we will deliver you the cause\r\n    Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,\r\n    Have thus proceeded.\r\n  ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.\r\n    Let each man render me his bloody hand.\r\n    First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;\r\n    Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;\r\n    Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;\r\n    Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;\r\n    Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.\r\n    Gentlemen all- alas, what shall I say?\r\n    My credit now stands on such slippery ground,\r\n    That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,\r\n    Either a coward or a flatterer.\r\n    That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!\r\n    If then thy spirit look upon us now,\r\n    Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death\r\n    To see thy Antony making his peace,\r\n    Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,\r\n    Most noble! In the presence of thy corse?\r\n    Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,\r\n    Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,\r\n    It would become me better than to close\r\n    In terms of friendship with thine enemies.\r\n    Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart,\r\n    Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,\r\n    Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe.\r\n    O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,\r\n    And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.\r\n    How like a deer strucken by many princes\r\n    Dost thou here lie!\r\n  CASSIUS. Mark Antony-\r\n  ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.\r\n    The enemies of Caesar shall say this:\r\n    Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.\r\n  CASSIUS. I blame you not for praising Caesar so;\r\n    But what compact mean you to have with us?\r\n    Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,\r\n    Or shall we on, and not depend on you?\r\n  ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed\r\n    Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.\r\n    Friends am I with you all and love you all,\r\n    Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons\r\n    Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.\r\n  BRUTUS. Or else were this a savage spectacle.\r\n    Our reasons are so full of good regard\r\n    That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,\r\n    You should be satisfied.\r\n  ANTONY. That's all I seek;\r\n    And am moreover suitor that I may\r\n    Produce his body to the marketplace,\r\n    And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,\r\n    Speak in the order of his funeral.\r\n  BRUTUS. You shall, Mark Antony.\r\n  CASSIUS. Brutus, a word with you.\r\n    [Aside to Brutus.] You know not what you do. Do not consent\r\n    That Antony speak in his funeral.\r\n    Know you how much the people may be moved\r\n    By that which he will utter?\r\n  BRUTUS. By your pardon,\r\n    I will myself into the pulpit first,\r\n    And show the reason of our Caesar's death.\r\n    What Antony shall speak, I will protest\r\n    He speaks by leave and by permission,\r\n    And that we are contented Caesar shall\r\n    Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.\r\n    It shall advantage more than do us wrong.\r\n  CASSIUS. I know not what may fall; I like it not.\r\n  BRUTUS. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.\r\n    You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,\r\n    But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,\r\n    And say you do't by our permission,\r\n    Else shall you not have any hand at all\r\n    About his funeral. And you shall speak\r\n    In the same pulpit whereto I am going,\r\n    After my speech is ended.\r\n  ANTONY. Be it so,\r\n    I do desire no more.\r\n  BRUTUS. Prepare the body then, and follow us.\r\n                                          Exeunt all but Antony.\r\n  ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,\r\n    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!\r\n    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man\r\n    That ever lived in the tide of times.\r\n    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!\r\n    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy\r\n    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips\r\n    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)\r\n    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;\r\n    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife\r\n    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;\r\n    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,\r\n    And dreadful objects so familiar,\r\n    That mothers shall but smile when they behold\r\n    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;\r\n    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,\r\n    And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,\r\n    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,\r\n    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice\r\n    Cry \"Havoc!\" and let slip the dogs of war,\r\n    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth\r\n    With carrion men, groaning for burial.\r\n\r\n                        Enter a Servant.\r\n\r\n    You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?\r\n  SERVANT. I do, Mark Antony.\r\n  ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.\r\n  SERVANT. He did receive his letters, and is coming,\r\n    And bid me say to you by word of mouth-\r\n    O Caesar!                                     Sees the body.\r\n  ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.\r\n    Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,\r\n    Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,\r\n    Began to water. Is thy master coming?\r\n  SERVANT. He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.\r\n  ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.\r\n    Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,\r\n    No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;\r\n    Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile,\r\n    Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse\r\n    Into the marketplace. There shall I try,\r\n    In my oration, how the people take\r\n    The cruel issue of these bloody men,\r\n    According to the which thou shalt discourse\r\n    To young Octavius of the state of things.\r\n    Lend me your hand.                Exeunt with Caesar's body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\nThe Forum.\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus and Cassius, and a throng of Citizens.\r\n\r\n  CITIZENS. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!\r\n  BRUTUS. Then follow me and give me audience, friends.\r\n    Cassius, go you into the other street\r\n    And part the numbers.\r\n    Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;\r\n    Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;\r\n    And public reasons shall be rendered\r\n    Of Caesar's death.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. I will hear Brutus speak.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons,\r\n    When severally we hear them rendered.\r\n                               Exit Cassius, with some Citizens.\r\n                                    Brutus goes into the pulpit.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!\r\n  BRUTUS. Be patient till the last.\r\n    Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and be\r\n    silent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and\r\nhave\r\n    respect to mine honor, that you may believe. Censure me in\r\nyour\r\n    wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge.\r\nIf\r\n    there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's,\r\nto\r\n    him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.\r\nIf\r\n    then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this\r\nis\r\n    my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved\r\nRome\r\n    more. Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves,\r\nthan\r\n    that Caesar were dead to live all freemen? As Caesar loved\r\nme, I\r\n    weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was\r\n    valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him.\r\nThere\r\n    is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his\r\nvalor,\r\n    and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be\r\na\r\n    bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here\r\nso\r\n    rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I\r\n    offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country?\r\nIf\r\n    any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.\r\n  ALL. None, Brutus, none.\r\n  BRUTUS. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to\r\nCaesar\r\n    than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is\r\n    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he\r\nwas\r\n    worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n              Enter Antony and others, with Caesar's body.\r\n\r\n    Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he\r\nhad\r\n    no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying,\r\na\r\n    place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not? With\r\nthis I\r\n    depart- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I\r\n    have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my\r\ncountry\r\n    to need my death.\r\n  ALL. Live, Brutus, live, live!\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Bring him with triumph home unto his house.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Give him a statue with his ancestors.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Let him be Caesar.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Caesar's better parts\r\n    Shall be crown'd in Brutus.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. We'll bring him to his house with shouts and\r\n    clamors.\r\n  BRUTUS. My countrymen-\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Peace, ho!\r\n  BRUTUS. Good countrymen, let me depart alone,\r\n    And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.\r\n    Do grace to Caesar's corse, and grace his speech\r\n    Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony,\r\n    By our permission, is allow'd to make.\r\n    I do entreat you, not a man depart,\r\n    Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.                  Exit.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Let him go up into the public chair;\r\n    We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.\r\n  ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.\r\n                                           Goes into the pulpit.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. What does he say of Brutus?\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. He says, for Brutus' sake,\r\n    He finds himself beholding to us all.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. 'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. This Caesar was a tyrant.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, that's certain.\r\n    We are blest that Rome is rid of him.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.\r\n  ANTONY. You gentle Romans-\r\n  ALL. Peace, ho! Let us hear him.\r\n  ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!\r\n    I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\r\n    The evil that men do lives after them,\r\n    The good is oft interred with their bones;\r\n    So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus\r\n    Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;\r\n    If it were so, it was a grievous fault,\r\n    And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.\r\n    Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-\r\n    For Brutus is an honorable man;\r\n    So are they all, all honorable men-\r\n    Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.\r\n    He was my friend, faithful and just to me;\r\n    But Brutus says he was ambitious,\r\n    And Brutus is an honorable man.\r\n    He hath brought many captives home to Rome,\r\n    Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.\r\n    Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?\r\n    When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;\r\n    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:\r\n    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,\r\n    And Brutus is an honorable man.\r\n    You all did see that on the Lupercal\r\n    I thrice presented him a kingly crown,\r\n    Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?\r\n    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,\r\n    And sure he is an honorable man.\r\n    I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,\r\n    But here I am to speak what I do know.\r\n    You all did love him once, not without cause;\r\n    What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?\r\n    O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,\r\n    And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;\r\n    My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\r\n    And I must pause till it come back to me.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. If thou consider rightly of the matter,\r\n    Caesar has had great wrong.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Has he, masters?\r\n    I fear there will a worse come in his place.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the\r\ncrown;\r\n    Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. If it be found so, some will dear abide it.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with\r\nweeping.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Now mark him, he begins again to speak.\r\n  ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might\r\n    Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,\r\n    And none so poor to do him reverence.\r\n    O masters! If I were disposed to stir\r\n    Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,\r\n    I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,\r\n    Who, you all know, are honorable men.\r\n    I will not do them wrong; I rather choose\r\n    To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,\r\n    Than I will wrong such honorable men.\r\n    But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;\r\n    I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.\r\n    Let but the commons hear this testament-\r\n    Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-\r\n    And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds\r\n    And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,\r\n    Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,\r\n    And, dying, mention it within their wills,\r\n    Bequeathing it as a rich legacy\r\n    Unto their issue.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.\r\n  ALL. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will.\r\n  ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;\r\n    It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.\r\n    You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;\r\n    And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,\r\n    It will inflame you, it will make you mad.\r\n    'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,\r\n    For if you should, O, what would come of it!\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.\r\n    You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.\r\n  ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?\r\n    I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.\r\n    I fear I wrong the honorable men\r\n    Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. They were traitors. Honorable men!\r\n  ALL. The will! The testament!\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. They were villains, murtherers. The will!\r\n    Read the will!\r\n  ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?\r\n    Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar,\r\n    And let me show you him that made the will.\r\n    Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?\r\n  ALL. Come down.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Descend.\r\n                                  He comes down from the pulpit.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. You shall have leave.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. A ring, stand round.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Room for Antony, most noble Antony.\r\n  ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.\r\n  ALL. Stand back; room, bear back!\r\n  ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.\r\n    You all do know this mantle. I remember\r\n    The first time ever Caesar put it on;\r\n    'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,\r\n    That day he overcame the Nervii.\r\n    Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through;\r\n    See what a rent the envious Casca made;\r\n    Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;\r\n    And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,\r\n    Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,\r\n    As rushing out of doors, to be resolved\r\n    If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;\r\n    For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel.\r\n    Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!\r\n    This was the most unkindest cut of all;\r\n    For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,\r\n    Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,\r\n    Quite vanquish'd him. Then burst his mighty heart,\r\n    And, in his mantle muffling up his face,\r\n    Even at the base of Pompey's statue,\r\n    Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.\r\n    O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!\r\n    Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,\r\n    Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.\r\n    O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel\r\n    The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.\r\n    Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold\r\n    Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,\r\n    Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. O piteous spectacle!\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. O noble Caesar!\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. O woeful day!\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. O traitors villains!\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. O most bloody sight!\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. We will be revenged.\r\n  ALL. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!\r\n    Slay! Let not a traitor live!\r\n  ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die\r\nwith\r\n    him.\r\n  ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up\r\n    To such a sudden flood of mutiny.\r\n    They that have done this deed are honorable.\r\n    What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,\r\n    That made them do it. They are wise and honorable,\r\n    And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.\r\n    I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.\r\n    I am no orator, as Brutus is;\r\n    But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,\r\n    That love my friend, and that they know full well\r\n    That gave me public leave to speak of him.\r\n    For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,\r\n    Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,\r\n    To stir men's blood. I only speak right on;\r\n    I tell you that which you yourselves do know;\r\n    Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor dumb mouths,\r\n    And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,\r\n    And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony\r\n    Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue\r\n    In every wound of Caesar that should move\r\n    The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.\r\n  ALL. We'll mutiny.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. We'll burn the house of Brutus.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.\r\n  ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.\r\n  ALL. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!\r\n  ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.\r\n    Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?\r\n    Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.\r\n    You have forgot the will I told you of.\r\n  ALL. Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will.\r\n  ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.\r\n    To every Roman citizen he gives,\r\n    To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. O royal Caesar!\r\n  ANTONY. Hear me with patience.\r\n  ALL. Peace, ho!\r\n  ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,\r\n    His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,\r\n    On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,\r\n    And to your heirs forever- common pleasures,\r\n    To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.\r\n    Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Never, never. Come, away, away!\r\n    We'll burn his body in the holy place\r\n    And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.\r\n    Take up the body.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Go fetch fire.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Pluck down benches.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Pluck down forms, windows, anything.\r\n                                  Exeunt Citizens with the body.\r\n  ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,\r\n    Take thou what course thou wilt.\r\n\r\n                        Enter a Servant.\r\n\r\n    How now, fellow?\r\n  SERVANT. Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.\r\n  ANTONY. Where is he?\r\n  SERVANT. He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.\r\n  ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.\r\n    He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,\r\n    And in this mood will give us anything.\r\n  SERVANT. I heard him say Brutus and Cassius\r\n    Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.\r\n  ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people,\r\n    How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.          Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\nA street.\r\n\r\nEnter Cinna the poet.\r\n\r\n  CINNA. I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,\r\n    And things unluckily charge my fantasy.\r\n    I have no will to wander forth of doors,\r\n    Yet something leads me forth.\r\n\r\n                        Enter Citizens.\r\n\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. What is your name?\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Whither are you going?\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Where do you dwell?\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Are you a married man or a bachelor?\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Answer every man directly.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, and briefly.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Ay, and wisely.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Ay, and truly, you were best.\r\n  CINNA. What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell?\r\nAm I\r\n    a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man\r\ndirectly\r\n    and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. That's as much as to say they are fools that\r\nmarry.\r\n    You'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed directly.\r\n  CINNA. Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. As a friend or an enemy?\r\n  CINNA. As a friend.\r\n  SECOND CITIZEN. That matter is answered directly.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. For your dwelling, briefly.\r\n  CINNA. Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Your name, sir, truly.\r\n  CINNA. Truly, my name is Cinna.\r\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator.\r\n  CINNA. I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his\r\nbad\r\n    verses.\r\n  CINNA. I am not Cinna the conspirator.\r\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. It is no matter, his name's Cinna. Pluck but\r\nhis\r\n    name out of his heart, and turn him going.\r\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Tear him, tear him! Come, brands, ho,\r\nfirebrands. To\r\n    Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all. Some to Decius' house, and\r\nsome\r\n    to Casca's, some to Ligarius'. Away, go!             Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n  ANTONY. These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?\r\n  LEPIDUS. I do consent-\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Prick him down, Antony.\r\n  LEPIDUS. Upon condition Publius shall not live,\r\n    Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.\r\n  ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.\r\n    But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house,\r\n    Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine\r\n    How to cut off some charge in legacies.\r\n  LEPIDUS. What, shall I find you here?\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Or here, or at the Capitol.            Exit Lepidus.\r\n  ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,\r\n    Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,\r\n    The three-fold world divided, he should stand\r\n    One of the three to share it?\r\n  OCTAVIUS. So you thought him,\r\n    And took his voice who should be prick'd to die\r\n    In our black sentence and proscription.\r\n  ANTONY. Octavius, I have seen more days than you,\r\n    And though we lay these honors on this man\r\n    To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,\r\n    He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,\r\n    To groan and sweat under the business,\r\n    Either led or driven, as we point the way;\r\n    And having brought our treasure where we will,\r\n    Then take we down his load and turn him off,\r\n    Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears\r\n    And graze in commons.\r\n  OCTAVIUS. You may do your will,\r\n    But he's a tried and valiant soldier.\r\n  ANTONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that\r\n    I do appoint him store of provender.\r\n    It is a creature that I teach to fight,\r\n    To wind, to stop, to run directly on,\r\n    His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.\r\n    And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:\r\n    He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;\r\n    A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds\r\n    On objects, arts, and imitations,\r\n    Which, out of use and staled by other men,\r\n    Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him\r\n    But as a property. And now, Octavius,\r\n    Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius\r\n    Are levying powers; we must straight make head;\r\n    Therefore let our alliance be combined,\r\n    Our best friends made, our means stretch'd;\r\n    And let us presently go sit in council,\r\n    How covert matters may be best disclosed,\r\n    And open perils surest answered.\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Let us do so, for we are at the stake,\r\n    And bay'd about with many enemies;\r\n    And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,\r\n    Millions of mischiefs.                               Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\nCamp near Sardis. Before Brutus' tent. Drum.\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus, Lucilius, Lucius, and Soldiers; Titinius and\r\nPindarus meet them.\r\n\r\n  BRUTUS. Stand, ho!\r\n  LUCILIUS. Give the word, ho, and stand.\r\n  BRUTUS. What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?\r\n  LUCILIUS. He is at hand, and Pindarus is come\r\n    To do you salutation from his master.\r\n  BRUTUS. He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,\r\n    In his own change, or by ill officers,\r\n    Hath given me some worthy cause to wish\r\n    Things done undone; but if he be at hand,\r\n    I shall be satisfied.\r\n  PINDARUS. I do not doubt\r\n    But that my noble master will appear\r\n    Such as he is, full of regard and honor.\r\n  BRUTUS. He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,\r\n    How he received you. Let me be resolved.\r\n  LUCILIUS. With courtesy and with respect enough,\r\n    But not with such familiar instances,\r\n    Nor with such free and friendly conference,\r\n    As he hath used of old.\r\n  BRUTUS. Thou hast described\r\n    A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,\r\n    When love begins to sicken and decay\r\n    It useth an enforced ceremony.\r\n    There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;\r\n    But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,\r\n    Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;\r\n    But when they should endure the bloody spur,\r\n    They fall their crests and like deceitful jades\r\n    Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?\r\n  LUCILIUS. They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;\r\n    The greater part, the horse in general,\r\n    Are come with Cassius.                     Low march within.\r\n  BRUTUS. Hark, he is arrived.\r\n    March gently on to meet him.\r\n\r\n                  Enter Cassius and his Powers.\r\n\r\n  CASSIUS. Stand, ho!\r\n  BRUTUS. Stand, ho! Speak the word along.\r\n  FIRST SOLDIER. Stand!\r\n  SECOND SOLDIER. Stand!\r\n  THIRD SOLDIER. Stand!\r\n  CASSIUS. Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.\r\n  BRUTUS. Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?\r\n    And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?\r\n  CASSIUS. Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,\r\n    And when you do them-\r\n  BRUTUS. Cassius, be content,\r\n    Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.\r\n    Before the eyes of both our armies here,\r\n    Which should perceive nothing but love from us,\r\n    Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away;\r\n    Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,\r\n    And I will give you audience.\r\n  CASSIUS. Pindarus,\r\n    Bid our commanders lead their charges off\r\n    A little from this ground.\r\n  BRUTUS. Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man\r\n    Come to our tent till we have done our conference.\r\n    Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.             Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\nBrutus' tent.\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus and Cassius.\r\n\r\n  CASSIUS. That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:\r\n    You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella\r\n    For taking bribes here of the Sardians,\r\n    Wherein my letters, praying on his side,\r\n    Because I knew the man, were slighted off.\r\n  BRUTUS. You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.\r\n  CASSIUS. In such a time as this it is not meet\r\n    That every nice offense should bear his comment.\r\n  BRUTUS. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself\r\n    Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm,\r\n    To sell and mart your offices for gold\r\n    To undeservers.\r\n  CASSIUS. I an itching palm?\r\n    You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,\r\n    Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.\r\n  BRUTUS. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,\r\n    And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.\r\n  CASSIUS. Chastisement?\r\n  BRUTUS. Remember March, the ides of March remember.\r\n    Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?\r\n    What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,\r\n    And not for justice? What, shall one of us,\r\n    That struck the foremost man of all this world\r\n    But for supporting robbers, shall we now\r\n    Contaminate our fingers with base bribes\r\n    And sell the mighty space of our large honors\r\n    For so much trash as may be grasped thus?\r\n    I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,\r\n    Than such a Roman.\r\n  CASSIUS. Brutus, bait not me,\r\n    I'll not endure it. You forget yourself\r\n    To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,\r\n    Older in practice, abler than yourself\r\n    To make conditions.\r\n  BRUTUS. Go to, you are not, Cassius.\r\n  CASSIUS. I am.\r\n  BRUTUS. I say you are not.\r\n  CASSIUS. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;\r\n    Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.\r\n  BRUTUS. Away, slight man!\r\n  CASSIUS. Is't possible?\r\n  BRUTUS. Hear me, for I will speak.\r\n    Must I give way and room to your rash choler?\r\n    Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?\r\n  CASSIUS. O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?\r\n  BRUTUS. All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.\r\n    Go show your slaves how choleric you are,\r\n    And make your bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?\r\n    Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch\r\n    Under your testy humor? By the gods,\r\n    You shall digest the venom of your spleen,\r\n    Though it do split you, for, from this day forth,\r\n    I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,\r\n    When you are waspish.\r\n  CASSIUS. Is it come to this?\r\n  BRUTUS. You say you are a better soldier:\r\n    Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,\r\n    And it shall please me well. For mine own part,\r\n    I shall be glad to learn of noble men.\r\n  CASSIUS. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.\r\n    I said, an elder soldier, not a better.\r\n    Did I say \"better\"?\r\n  BRUTUS. If you did, I care not.\r\n  CASSIUS. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.\r\n  BRUTUS. Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.\r\n  CASSIUS. I durst not?\r\n  BRUTUS. No.\r\n  CASSIUS. What, durst not tempt him?\r\n  BRUTUS. For your life you durst not.\r\n  CASSIUS. Do not presume too much upon my love;\r\n    I may do that I shall be sorry for.\r\n  BRUTUS. You have done that you should be sorry for.\r\n    There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,\r\n    For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,\r\n    That they pass by me as the idle wind\r\n    Which I respect not. I did send to you\r\n    For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,\r\n    For I can raise no money by vile means.\r\n    By heaven, I had rather coin my heart\r\n    And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring\r\n    From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash\r\n    By any indirection. I did send\r\n    To you for gold to pay my legions,\r\n    Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?\r\n    Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?\r\n    When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous\r\n    To lock such rascal counters from his friends,\r\n    Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,\r\n    Dash him to pieces!\r\n  CASSIUS. I denied you not.\r\n  BRUTUS. You did.\r\n  CASSIUS. I did not. He was but a fool\r\n    That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.\r\n    A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,\r\n    But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.\r\n  BRUTUS. I do not, till you practise them on me.\r\n  CASSIUS. You love me not.\r\n  BRUTUS. I do not like your faults.\r\n  CASSIUS. A friendly eye could never see such faults.\r\n  BRUTUS. A flatterer's would not, though they do appear\r\n    As huge as high Olympus.\r\n  CASSIUS. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,\r\n    Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,\r\n    For Cassius is aweary of the world:\r\n    Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;\r\n    Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,\r\n    Set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,\r\n    To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep\r\n    My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,\r\n    And here my naked breast; within, a heart\r\n    Dearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold.\r\n    If that thou best a Roman, take it forth;\r\n    I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.\r\n    Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know,\r\n    When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better\r\n    Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.\r\n  BRUTUS. Sheathe your dagger.\r\n    Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;\r\n    Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.\r\n    O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,\r\n    That carries anger as the flint bears fire,\r\n    Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark\r\n    And straight is cold again.\r\n  CASSIUS. Hath Cassius lived\r\n    To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,\r\n    When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?\r\n  BRUTUS. When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.\r\n  CASSIUS. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.\r\n  BRUTUS. And my heart too.\r\n  CASSIUS. O Brutus!\r\n  BRUTUS. What's the matter?\r\n  CASSIUS. Have not you love enough to bear with me\r\n    When that rash humor which my mother gave me\r\n    Makes me forgetful?\r\n  BRUTUS. Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,\r\n    When you are overearnest with your Brutus,\r\n    He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.\r\n  POET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.\r\n    There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet\r\n    They be alone.\r\n  LUCILIUS. [Within.] You shall not come to them.\r\n  POET. [Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.\r\n\r\n      Enter Poet, followed by Lucilius, Titinius, and Lucius.\r\n\r\n  CASSIUS. How now, what's the matter?\r\n  POET. For shame, you generals! What do you mean?\r\n    Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;\r\n    For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.\r\n  CASSIUS. Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!\r\n  BRUTUS. Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!\r\n  CASSIUS. Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.\r\n  BRUTUS. I'll know his humor when he knows his time.\r\n    What should the wars do with these jigging fools?\r\n    Companion, hence!\r\n  CASSIUS. Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.\r\n  BRUTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders\r\n    Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.\r\n  CASSIUS. And come yourselves and bring Messala with you\r\n    Immediately to us.             Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius.\r\n  BRUTUS. Lucius, a bowl of wine!                   Exit Lucius.\r\n  CASSIUS. I did not think you could have been so angry.\r\n  BRUTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.\r\n  CASSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,\r\n    If you give place to accidental evils.\r\n  BRUTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.\r\n  CASSIUS. Ha? Portia?\r\n  BRUTUS. She is dead.\r\n  CASSIUS. How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?\r\n    O insupportable and touching loss!\r\n    Upon what sickness?\r\n  BRUTUS. Impatient of my absence,\r\n    And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony\r\n    Have made themselves so strong- for with her death\r\n    That tidings came- with this she fell distract,\r\n    And (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire.\r\n  CASSIUS. And died so?\r\n  BRUTUS. Even so.\r\n  CASSIUS. O ye immortal gods!\r\n\r\n               Re-enter Lucius, with wine and taper.\r\n\r\n  BRUTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.\r\n    In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.              Drinks.\r\n  CASSIUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.\r\n  Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;\r\n  I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.               Drinks.\r\n  BRUTUS. Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.\r\n\r\n                 Re-enter Titinius, with Messala.\r\n\r\n    Welcome, good Messala.\r\n    Now sit we close about this taper here,\r\n    And call in question our necessities.\r\n  CASSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?\r\n  BRUTUS. No more, I pray you.\r\n    Messala, I have here received letters\r\n    That young Octavius and Mark Antony\r\n    Come down upon us with a mighty power,\r\n    Bending their expedition toward Philippi.\r\n  MESSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.\r\n  BRUTUS. With what addition?\r\n  MESSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry\r\n    Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus\r\n    Have put to death an hundred senators.\r\n  BRUTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;\r\n    Mine speak of seventy senators that died\r\n    By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.\r\n  CASSIUS. Cicero one!\r\n  MESSALA. Cicero is dead,\r\n    And by that order of proscription.\r\n    Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?\r\n  BRUTUS. No, Messala.\r\n  MESSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?\r\n  BRUTUS. Nothing, Messala.\r\n  MESSALA. That, methinks, is strange.\r\n  BRUTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?\r\n  MESSALA. No, my lord.\r\n  BRUTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.\r\n  MESSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:\r\n    For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.\r\n  BRUTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.\r\n    With meditating that she must die once\r\n    I have the patience to endure it now.\r\n  MESSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.\r\n  CASSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,\r\n    But yet my nature could not bear it so.\r\n  BRUTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think\r\n    Of marching to Philippi presently?\r\n  CASSIUS. I do not think it good.\r\n  BRUTUS. Your reason?\r\n  CASSIUS. This it is:\r\n    'Tis better that the enemy seek us;\r\n    So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,\r\n    Doing himself offense, whilst we lying still\r\n    Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.\r\n  BRUTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.\r\n    The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground\r\n    Do stand but in a forced affection,\r\n    For they have grudged us contribution.\r\n    The enemy, marching along by them,\r\n    By them shall make a fuller number up,\r\n    Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;\r\n    From which advantage shall we cut him off\r\n    If at Philippi we do face him there,\r\n    These people at our back.\r\n  CASSIUS. Hear me, good brother.\r\n  BRUTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside\r\n    That we have tried the utmost of our friends,\r\n    Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:\r\n    The enemy increaseth every day;\r\n    We, at the height, are ready to decline.\r\n    There is a tide in the affairs of men\r\n    Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;\r\n    Omitted, all the voyage of their life\r\n    Is bound in shallows and in miseries.\r\n    On such a full sea are we now afloat,\r\n    And we must take the current when it serves,\r\n    Or lose our ventures.\r\n  CASSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;\r\n    We'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.\r\n  BRUTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,\r\n    And nature must obey necessity,\r\n    Which we will niggard with a little rest.\r\n    There is no more to say?\r\n  CASSIUS. No more. Good night.\r\n    Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.\r\n  BRUTUS. Lucius!\r\n\r\n                       Re-enter Lucius.\r\n\r\n    My gown.                                        Exit Lucius.\r\n    Farewell, good Messala;\r\n    Good night, Titinius; noble, noble Cassius,\r\n    Good night and good repose.\r\n  CASSIUS. O my dear brother!\r\n    This was an ill beginning of the night.\r\n    Never come such division 'tween our souls!\r\n    Let it not, Brutus.\r\n  BRUTUS. Everything is well.\r\n  CASSIUS. Good night, my lord.\r\n  BRUTUS. Good night, good brother.\r\n  TITINIUS. MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.\r\n  BRUTUS. Farewell, everyone.\r\n                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.\r\n\r\n               Re-enter Lucius, with the gown.\r\n\r\n    Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?\r\n  LUCIUS. Here in the tent.\r\n  BRUTUS. What, thou speak'st drowsily?\r\n    Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'erwatch'd.\r\n    Call Claudio and some other of my men,\r\n    I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.\r\n  LUCIUS. Varro and Claudio!\r\n\r\n                   Enter Varro and Claudio.\r\n\r\n  VARRO. Calls my lord?\r\n  BRUTUS. I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;\r\n    It may be I shall raise you by and by\r\n    On business to my brother Cassius.\r\n  VARRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.\r\n  BRUTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.\r\n    It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.\r\n    Look Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;\r\n    I put it in the pocket of my gown.\r\n                                     Varro and Claudio lie down.\r\n  LUCIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.\r\n  BRUTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.\r\n    Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,\r\n    And touch thy instrument a strain or two?\r\n  LUCIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you.\r\n  BRUTUS. It does, my boy.\r\n    I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.\r\n  LUCIUS. It is my duty, sir.\r\n  BRUTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;\r\n    I know young bloods look for a time of rest.\r\n  LUCIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.\r\n  BRUTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;\r\n    I will not hold thee long. If I do live,\r\n    I will be good to thee.                   Music, and a song.\r\n    This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,\r\n    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy\r\n    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.\r\n    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.\r\n    If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;\r\n    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.\r\n    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down\r\n    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.        Sits down.\r\n\r\n                 Enter the Ghost of Caesar.\r\n\r\n    How ill this taper burns! Ha, who comes here?\r\n    I think it is the weakness of mine eyes\r\n    That shapes this monstrous apparition.\r\n    It comes upon me. Art thou anything?\r\n    Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil\r\n    That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?\r\n    Speak to me what thou art.\r\n  GHOST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.\r\n  BRUTUS. Why comest thou?\r\n  GHOST. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.\r\n  BRUTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?\r\n  GHOST. Ay, at Philippi.\r\n  BRUTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.\r\n    Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.\r\n    Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.\r\n    Boy! Lucius! Varro! Claudio! Sirs, awake!\r\n    Claudio!\r\n  LUCIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.\r\n  BRUTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.\r\n    Lucius, awake!\r\n  LUCIUS. My lord?\r\n  BRUTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?\r\n  LUCIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.\r\n  BRUTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?\r\n  LUCIUS. Nothing, my lord.\r\n  BRUTUS. Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!\r\n    [To Varro.] Fellow thou, awake!\r\n  VARRO. My lord?\r\n  CLAUDIO. My lord?\r\n  BRUTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?\r\n  VARRO. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?\r\n  BRUTUS. Ay, saw you anything?\r\n  VARRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.\r\n  CLAUDIO. Nor I, my lord.\r\n  BRUTUS. Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;\r\n    Bid him set on his powers betimes before,\r\n    And we will follow.\r\n  VARRO. CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.             Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.

SCENE I.\r\nThe plains of Philippi.\r\n\r\nEnter Octavius, Antony, and their Army.\r\n\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.\r\n    You said the enemy would not come down,\r\n    But keep the hills and upper regions.\r\n    It proves not so. Their battles are at hand;\r\n    They mean to warn us at Philippi here,\r\n    Answering before we do demand of them.\r\n  ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know\r\n    Wherefore they do it. They could be content\r\n    To visit other places, and come down\r\n    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face\r\n    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;\r\n    But 'tis not so.\r\n\r\n                    Enter a Messenger.\r\n\r\n  MESSENGER. Prepare you, generals.\r\n    The enemy comes on in gallant show;\r\n    Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,\r\n    And something to be done immediately.\r\n  ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,\r\n    Upon the left hand of the even field.\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.\r\n  ANTONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?\r\n  OCTAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.\r\n\r\n      March. Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their Army;\r\n           Lucilius, Titinius, Messala, and others.\r\n\r\n  BRUTUS. They stand, and would have parley.\r\n  CASSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?\r\n  ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.\r\n    Make forth, the generals would have some words.\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.\r\n  BRUTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.\r\n  BRUTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.\r\n  ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.\r\n    Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,\r\n    Crying \"Long live! Hail, Caesar!\"\r\n  CASSIUS. Antony,\r\n    The posture of your blows are yet unknown;\r\n    But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,\r\n    And leave them honeyless.\r\n  ANTONY. Not stingless too.\r\n  BRUTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,\r\n    For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,\r\n    And very wisely threat before you sting.\r\n  ANTONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers\r\n    Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar.\r\n    You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,\r\n    And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;\r\n    Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind\r\n    Strooke Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!\r\n  CASSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.\r\n    This tongue had not offended so today,\r\n    If Cassius might have ruled.\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,\r\n    The proof of it will turn to redder drops.\r\n    Look,\r\n    I draw a sword against conspirators;\r\n    When think you that the sword goes up again?\r\n    Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds\r\n    Be well avenged, or till another Caesar\r\n    Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.\r\n  BRUTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,\r\n    Unless thou bring'st them with thee.\r\n  OCTAVIUS. So I hope,\r\n    I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.\r\n  BRUTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,\r\n    Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.\r\n  CASSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,\r\n    Join'd with a masker and a reveler!\r\n  ANTONY. Old Cassius still!\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!\r\n    Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.\r\n    If you dare fight today, come to the field;\r\n    If not, when you have stomachs.\r\n                        Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their Army.\r\n  CASSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!\r\n    The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.\r\n  BRUTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.\r\n  LUCILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?\r\n                             Brutus and Lucilius converse apart.\r\n  CASSIUS. Messala!\r\n  MESSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?\r\n  CASSIUS. Messala,\r\n    This is my birthday, as this very day\r\n    Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.\r\n    Be thou my witness that, against my will,\r\n    As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set\r\n    Upon one battle all our liberties.\r\n    You know that I held Epicurus strong,\r\n    And his opinion. Now I change my mind,\r\n    And partly credit things that do presage.\r\n    Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign\r\n    Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,\r\n    Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands,\r\n    Who to Philippi here consorted us.\r\n    This morning are they fled away and gone,\r\n    And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites\r\n    Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,\r\n    As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem\r\n    A canopy most fatal, under which\r\n    Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.\r\n  MESSALA. Believe not so.\r\n  CASSIUS. I but believe it partly,\r\n    For I am fresh of spirit and resolved\r\n    To meet all perils very constantly.\r\n  BRUTUS. Even so, Lucilius.\r\n  CASSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,\r\n    The gods today stand friendly that we may,\r\n    Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!\r\n    But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,\r\n    Let's reason with the worst that may befall.\r\n    If we do lose this battle, then is this\r\n    The very last time we shall speak together.\r\n    What are you then determined to do?\r\n  BRUTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy\r\n    By which I did blame Cato for the death\r\n    Which he did give himself- I know not how,\r\n    But I do find it cowardly and vile,\r\n    For fear of what might fall, so to prevent\r\n    The time of life- arming myself with patience\r\n    To stay the providence of some high powers\r\n    That govern us below.\r\n  CASSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,\r\n    You are contented to be led in triumph\r\n    Thorough the streets of Rome?\r\n  BRUTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,\r\n    That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;\r\n    He bears too great a mind. But this same day\r\n    Must end that work the ides of March begun.\r\n    And whether we shall meet again I know not.\r\n    Therefore our everlasting farewell take.\r\n    Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!\r\n    If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;\r\n    If not, why then this parting was well made.\r\n  CASSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!\r\n    If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;\r\n    If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.\r\n  BRUTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know\r\n    The end of this day's business ere it come!\r\n    But it sufficeth that the day will end,\r\n    And then the end is known. Come, ho! Away!           Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\nThe field of battle.\r\n\r\nAlarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.\r\n\r\n  BRUTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills\r\n    Unto the legions on the other side.             Loud alarum.\r\n    Let them set on at once, for I perceive\r\n    But cold demeanor in Octavia's wing,\r\n    And sudden push gives them the overthrow.\r\n    Ride, ride, Messala. Let them all come down.         Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\nAnother part of the field.\r\n\r\nAlarums. Enter Cassius and Titinius.\r\n\r\n  CASSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!\r\n    Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy.\r\n    This ensign here of mine was turning back;\r\n    I slew the coward, and did take it from him.\r\n  TITINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,\r\n    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,\r\n    Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,\r\n    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.\r\n\r\n                       Enter Pindarus.\r\n\r\n  PINDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;\r\n    Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord;\r\n    Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.\r\n  CASSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:\r\n    Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?\r\n  TITINIUS. They are, my lord.\r\n  CASSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,\r\n    Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,\r\n    Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops\r\n    And here again, that I may rest assured\r\n    Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.\r\n  TITINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.\r\n  CASSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;\r\n    My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,\r\n    And tell me what thou notest about the field.\r\n                                      Pindarus ascends the hill.\r\n    This day I breathed first: time is come round,\r\n    And where I did begin, there shall I end;\r\n    My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?\r\n  PINDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!\r\n  CASSIUS. What news?\r\n  PINDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about\r\n    With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;\r\n    Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.\r\n    Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.\r\n    He's ta'en [Shout.] And, hark! They shout for joy.\r\n  CASSIUS. Come down; behold no more.\r\n    O, coward that I am, to live so long,\r\n    To see my best friend ta'en before my face!\r\n                                              Pindarus descends.\r\n    Come hither, sirrah.\r\n    In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,\r\n    And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,\r\n    That whatsoever I did bid thee do,\r\n    Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;\r\n    Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,\r\n    That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.\r\n    Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;\r\n    And when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,\r\n    Guide thou the sword. [Pindarus stabs him.] Caesar, thou art\r\n      revenged,\r\n    Even with the sword that kill'd thee.                  Dies.\r\n  PINDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,\r\n    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!\r\n    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,\r\n    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit.\r\n\r\n                Re-enter Titinius with Messala.\r\n\r\n  MESSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius\r\n    Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,\r\n    As Cassius' legions are by Antony.\r\n  TITINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.\r\n  MESSALA. Where did you leave him?\r\n  TITINIUS. All disconsolate,\r\n    With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.\r\n  MESSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?\r\n  TITINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!\r\n  MESSALA. Is not that he?\r\n  TITINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,\r\n    But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,\r\n    As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,\r\n    So in his red blood Cassius' day is set,\r\n    The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;\r\n    Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!\r\n    Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.\r\n  MESSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.\r\n    O hateful error, melancholy's child,\r\n    Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men\r\n    The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,\r\n    Thou never comest unto a happy birth,\r\n    But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!\r\n  TITINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?\r\n  MESSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet\r\n    The noble Brutus, thrusting this report\r\n    Into his ears. I may say \"thrusting\" it,\r\n    For piercing steel and darts envenomed\r\n    Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus\r\n    As tidings of this sight.\r\n  TITINIUS. Hie you, Messala,\r\n    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.\r\n    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?\r\n    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they\r\n    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,\r\n    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?\r\n    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!\r\n    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;\r\n    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I\r\n    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,\r\n    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.\r\n    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.\r\n    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.\r\n                                                  Kills himself.\r\n\r\n       Alarum. Re-enter Messala, with Brutus, young Cato,\r\n                         and others.\r\n\r\n  BRUTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?\r\n  MESSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.\r\n  BRUTUS. Titinius' face is upward.\r\n  CATO. He is slain.\r\n  BRUTUS. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!\r\n    Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords\r\n    In our own proper entrails.                     Low alarums.\r\n  CATO. Brave Titinius!\r\n    Look whe'er he have not crown'd dead Cassius!\r\n  BRUTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these?\r\n    The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!\r\n    It is impossible that ever Rome\r\n    Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe moe tears\r\n    To this dead man than you shall see me pay.\r\n    I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.\r\n    Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;\r\n    His funerals shall not be in our camp,\r\n    Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come,\r\n    And come, young Cato; let us to the field.\r\n    Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.\r\n    'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night\r\n    We shall try fortune in a second fight.              Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.\r\nAnother part of the field.\r\n\r\nAlarum. Enter, fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then Brutus,\r\nyoung Cato,\r\nLucilius, and others.\r\n\r\n  BRUTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!\r\n  CATO. What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?\r\n    I will proclaim my name about the field.\r\n    I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!\r\n    A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.\r\n    I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!\r\n  BRUTUS. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;\r\n    Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!       Exit.\r\n  LUCILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down?\r\n    Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,\r\n    And mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son.\r\n  FIRST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.\r\n  LUCILIUS. Only I yield to die.\r\n    [Offers money.] There is so much that thou wilt kill me\r\nstraight:\r\n    Kill Brutus, and be honor'd in his death.\r\n  FIRST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner!\r\n  SECOND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.\r\n  FIRST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.\r\n\r\n                         Enter Antony.\r\n\r\n    Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.\r\n  ANTONY. Where is he?\r\n  LUCILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.\r\n    I dare assure thee that no enemy\r\n    Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus;\r\n    The gods defend him from so great a shame!\r\n    When you do find him, or alive or dead,\r\n    He will be found like Brutus, like himself.\r\n  ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,\r\n    A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,\r\n    Give him all kindness; I had rather have\r\n    Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,\r\n    And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead,\r\n    And bring us word unto Octavius' tent\r\n    How everything is chanced.                           Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE V.\r\nAnother part of the field.\r\n\r\nEnter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.\r\n\r\n  BRUTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.\r\n  CLITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,\r\n    He came not back. He is or ta'en or slain.\r\n  BRUTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:\r\n    It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.        Whispers.\r\n  CLITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.\r\n  BRUTUS. Peace then, no words.\r\n  CLITUS. I'll rather kill myself.\r\n  BRUTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.\r\n  DARDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?\r\n  CLITUS. O Dardanius!\r\n  DARDANIUS. O Clitus!\r\n  CLITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?\r\n  DARDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.\r\n  CLITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,\r\n    That it runs over even at his eyes.\r\n  BRUTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.\r\n  VOLUMNIUS. What says my lord?\r\n  BRUTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:\r\n    The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me\r\n    Two several times by night; at Sardis once,\r\n    And this last night here in Philippi fields.\r\n    I know my hour is come.\r\n  VOLUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.\r\n  BRUTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.\r\n    Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;\r\n    Our enemies have beat us to the pit;            Low alarums.\r\n    It is more worthy to leap in ourselves\r\n    Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,\r\n    Thou know'st that we two went to school together;\r\n    Even for that our love of old, I prithee,\r\n    Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.\r\n  VOLUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.\r\n                                                   Alarum still.\r\n  CLITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.\r\n  BRUTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.\r\n    Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;\r\n    Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,\r\n    My heart doth joy that yet in all my life\r\n    I found no man but he was true to me.\r\n    I shall have glory by this losing day,\r\n    More than Octavius and Mark Antony\r\n    By this vile conquest shall attain unto.\r\n    So, fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue\r\n    Hath almost ended his life's history.\r\n    Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would rest\r\n    That have but labor'd to attain this hour.\r\n                            Alarum. Cry within, \"Fly, fly, fly!\"\r\n  CLITUS. Fly, my lord, fly.\r\n  BRUTUS. Hence! I will follow.\r\n                        Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius, and Volumnius.\r\n    I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.\r\n    Thou art a fellow of a good respect;\r\n    Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.\r\n    Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,\r\n    While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?\r\n  STRATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.\r\n  BRUTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.\r\n    Caesar, now be still;\r\n    I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.            Dies.\r\n\r\n     Alarum. Retreat. Enter Octavius, Antony, Messala,\r\n                 Lucilius, and the Army.\r\n\r\n  OCTAVIUS. What man is that?\r\n  MESSALA. My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?\r\n  STRATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:\r\n    The conquerors can but make a fire of him;\r\n    For Brutus only overcame himself,\r\n    And no man else hath honor by his death.\r\n  LUCILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,\r\n    That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.\r\n  OCTAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.\r\n    Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?\r\n  STRATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.\r\n  OCTAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.\r\n  MESSALA. How died my master, Strato?\r\n  STRATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it.\r\n  MESSALA. Octavius, then take him to follow thee\r\n    That did the latest service to my master.\r\n  ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all.\r\n    All the conspirators, save only he,\r\n    Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;\r\n    He only, in a general honest thought\r\n    And common good to all, made one of them.\r\n    His life was gentle, and the elements\r\n    So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up\r\n    And say to all the world, \"This was a man!\"\r\n  OCTAVIUS. According to his virtue let us use him\r\n    With all respect and rites of burial.\r\n    Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,\r\n    Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.\r\n    So call the field to rest, and let's away,\r\n    To part the glories of this happy day.              Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\r\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\r\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\r\nWITH PERMISSION.
